SARAL is an acronym for \n\"SAtellite for ARgos and ALtiKa\" with two payloads namely AltiKa, a Ka-band (35-GHz) radar \naltimeter and ARGOS, a data collection platform for a variety of physical and biological data \nfrom ocean in-situ instruments like Ocean buoys etc. SARAL realizes ocean radar altimetry \nthrough a suite of altimetry payloads which includes the DORIS and LRA instruments for \nprecise orbit determination (POD); a dual-frequency microwave radiometer (MWR) at \n24/37GHz for water vapor correction.  At 35 GHz, not only is the ionospheric contamination of \nthe pulse echo negligible, it also gives a better vertical resolution of about 0.3m for wave \nestimation and a compact, light-weight instrument for greater portability.  \nThe objectives of AltiKa mission are: To realize precise, repetitive global measurements of sea \nsurface for studying mesoscale variability, developing coastal oceanography, inland waters and \nice sheets monitoring and understanding of climate change.  \nThis document is User Handbook for the “Moving closer to the coast by SARAL/AltiKa: \nGeophysical Product for Indian Mainland Region”. This product was conceived in the \nframework of deriving high resolution “Coastal Product” project under SARAL/AltiKa mission.   \nThis coastal product is an experimental product derived from SARAL/AltiKa S-IGDR tracks. \nThe document provides an insight to coastal product and various algorithms used in its \nderivation. It is advised that user refer the SARAL/AltiKa product handbook (SARAL/AltiKa User \nHandbook, Dec, 2013), as present document is an add-on with specific retrackers and quality flags \nfor 40-Hz data processing. \n \n \nFigure 1. Different tracks of SARAL AltiKa (in white) near Indian coast used in the study. \nTracks are overlaid on ocean bathymetry. Along-track coastal 40-Hz products are derived up to \n50 km from the coast. \n2 \n \n1.1 Overview of the product \nIn Open Ocean, the altimetric echo follows a standard shape, with steeply rising leading edge \nfollowed by a trailing edge with gradually diminishing power. This standard shape is in \nagreement with the theoretical Brown model (Brown 1977) and hence can be easily modeled. \nOutput of the Brown model is sea surface height (SSH), significant wave height (SWH) and \nbackscatter coefficient (Sigma (0)). Sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) is further computed \nfrom SSH. The waveforms measured in the coastal area do not conform to the theoretical Brown \nmodel due to land contamination and inaccurate geophysical corrections.  Special data \nprocessing efforts are needed for coastal region. SARAL/AltiKa coastal product is concerned \nwith providing the geo-physical parameters SSHA, SSH, SWH and Wind Speed from the \nretracking algorithms BETA5, BETA9 and BAGP at 40-Hz data rate. The distance between the \nconsecutive points in the 40-Hz data is approximately 180 meters.

Processing involved in the coastal product and parameters provided \nPrior to describing, the processing involved in deriving coastal products, it will be useful to \nunderstand the procedure involved in the computation of geo physical parameters from altimeter \nin the open ocean. In the following sections we first discuss the open ocean altimeter data \nprocessing. \n \n3.1 Altimeter Data Processing for Open Ocean \nBasic measurement of an altimeter is in form of a time series known as waveform in which \npower is distributed along various measuring gates of an altimeter as depicted in Figure 2. These \ngates arise due to signal processing and decide the vertical resolution of the altimeter. A model is \nfitted to the altimeter waveform, and the model parameters provide the geophysical parameters \nor their corrections. Fitted model is shown as blue curve in the same Figure. This process of \nmodeling the altimetric waveform is known as retracking and the specific model used for \nretracking is known as a retracker.  A theoretical model (known as MLE4 retracker), based on \nthe scattering of a radar pulse from the sea-surface, was formulated by Brown (1977) and is \nextensively used for open ocean waveform retracking. \n4 \n \n \n \n Figure 2. A typical open ocean waveform from SARAL/AltiKa (red) and fitted waveform by the \nMLE4 retracker in blue   \nTo the first order, this model is given as by Amarouche et al. (2004)  \n            𝑊(𝑡) = (\n𝐴\n2) 𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝑣) [1 + 𝑒𝑟𝑓 (𝑢)]  \n \n \n \n \n               \nwhere \n𝑢  =  \n𝑡−𝑡0−𝛼𝜎𝑐2\n√ 2𝜎𝑐\n  ,  𝑣= 𝛼(𝑡−𝑡0 −\n𝛼\n2 𝜎𝑐\n2)  \n \n \n \n \n(3.1) \n𝛼= 𝛿−\n𝛽2\n4   \n𝛽 = (4/𝛾)(𝑐/ℎ)1/2𝑠𝑖𝑛 (2𝜉) , 𝛿 = (4/𝛾)(𝑐/ℎ)𝑐𝑜𝑠(2𝜉)  \n𝑐 is speed of light   \nℎ is the height of the satellite platform, erf(𝑥) =\n2\n√𝜋 ∫𝑒−𝑧2𝑑𝑧\n𝑥\n0\n \n𝛾 = (1/2)ln2 sin2θ-3dB, θ-3dB being the half-power antenna beam width. \n𝐴 is the amplitude scaling term of the waveform. \n𝜉 is the satellite antenna mispointing angle \n𝜎𝑐 is the composite rise-time \n5 \n \n𝑡0 is the midpoint of the leading edge with reference to a fixed tracker bin. This bin is 52 for \nSARAL/AltiKa. \n σc\n2 = σp\n2 + (  \n 2\nc    σs )2 \n SWH =  4𝜎𝑠 \nwhere 𝜎𝑝 is radar antenna parameter  and 𝜎𝑠 is the RMS surface elevation . \nBrown Model and the retrieved parameters are shown in Figure. 3. Note that thermal noise is \nalso present in the actual altimetric waveforms. \n \nFigure 3. Brown model and the related retrieved parameters. \n \nFitting the waveform model with the altimetric waveform is done using the Maximum \nLikelihood Estimator (MLE) technique explained in Amarouche et al. (2004). After fitting the \ntheoretical model to the altimetric waveform three basic parameters are computed as described in \nthe following sub-sections. \n \n \n6 \n \n3.1.1 Computation of Sea Surface Height Anomaly  \nParameter 𝑡0 computed from equation 3.1 gives retracking correction to the range calculated by \nthe onboard tracker on the satellite. The range is also corrected for the geophysical and the \ninstrument corrections. \nCorrected Altimeter Range = Tracker Range + 𝒕𝟎 + geophysical corrections + instrument \ncorrections. \nAltimeter range is then subtracted from the Altitude of satellite to give the SSH. Geophysical \ncorrections in the altimeter will be discussed in the Section 5.  \nSSH = Altitude - Corrected Altimeter Range \nSea Surface Height Anomaly (SSHA) is then calculated by subtracting Mean Sea Surface (MSS). \nMSS is the long term mean of the Sea Surface Height calculated by averaging the SSH by the \nprevious satellite altimeters. \nSSHA = SSH - MSS \n \n3.1.2 Computation of Significant Wave Height  \n𝜎𝑐 from equation 3.1 is the composite rise time of the waveform. This parameter is obtained by \nfitting   the waveform with the theoretical model. Antenna characteristic 𝜎𝑝 is already known. So \nwe can compute  𝜎𝑠 which is root mean square (RMS) surface elevation. \n(   \n2\nc  σs )2 = σc\n2 - σp\n2 \nwhere c is speed of light \nSWH is approximated as four times the RMS elevation 𝜎𝑠. \n𝑆𝑊𝐻 =  4𝜎𝑠 \n \n7 \n \n3.1.3 Computation of Wind Speed \nWind speed is obtained generally using empirical relationships based on backscatter coefficient \n𝜎0 which is obtained by the ′𝐴′ term in the equation 3.1 as follows \n𝝈𝟎(𝒅𝑩) = 𝟏𝟎𝐥𝐨𝐠(𝑨) + 𝒔𝒄𝒂𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒇𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒐𝒓+ 𝒂𝒕𝒎𝒐𝒔𝒑𝒆𝒉𝒆𝒓𝒊𝒄 𝒄𝒐𝒓𝒓𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏\n+ 𝒊𝒏𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒖𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝒄𝒐𝒓𝒓𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒔 \nScaling factor accounts for all the parameters of the radar equation except the amplitude of the \nwaveform.  𝜎0 is also accounted for the atmospheric correction due to propagation in medium \nand the instrument corrections. \nThe wind speed is calculated in S-IGDR by using one dimensional model given by Lillibridge et \nal. (2014) which is a function of backscatter coefficient. Equations for calculating   wind speed \nusing one dimensional model are shown below \n𝑈𝑚= {𝛼−𝛽𝜎0              𝑖𝑓 𝜎0 ≤ 𝜎𝑏 \n𝛾𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝛿𝜎0)      𝑖𝑓 𝜎0  > 𝜎𝑏\n  \n \n \n \n(3.2) \nwhere 𝛼= 34.2, 𝛽= 2.48, 𝛾= 720, 𝛿= 0.42 and 𝜎𝑏= 11.4 \n      Wind speed = 𝑈𝑚+ 1.4 𝑈𝑚\n0.096 𝑒𝑥𝑝 (−0.32𝑈𝑚\n1.096) \nOne dimensional model from eqn. (3.2) is used for calculating wind speed from backscatter \ncoefficient obtained from all the retracking algorithms.  \nNote: In general, the geophysical parameters are calculated at 40-Hz and then averaged \nover 1-Hz by using some filtering procedure. But in coastal regions 1-Hz resolution which \nis approx. 7 km, is not very useful to provide the resolution needed for most of the coastal \napplications. 40-Hz data can be noisy due to limited averaging. Therefore, 40-Hz data can \nbe used for research purposes in coastal regions.  It is suggested that the 40-Hz data should \nbe filtered and averaged according to the specific applications. \nGeophysical parameters computed from the Ocean retracker as provided in the S-IGDR product \nare also provided. The list of these parameters is given below: \nSSHA                 ::     ssha_mle4_40hz \n8 \n \nSSH                    ::     ssh_mle4_40hz \nSWH                  ::     swh_mle4_40hz \nWIND SPEED   ::      wind_speed_mle4_40hz \n \n3.2 Retracking algorithms used in the coastal product \n    Although eqn. 3.1 (ocean model) works well in the Open Ocean, in the coastal areas this \nmodel fails due to incursion of the land in the footprint of the altimeter as shown in Figure 4. In \norder to encounter this contamination, specific retracking algorithms are used in the coastal \nregions.  \n \nFigure 4.  Sample waveform  in the Coastal Ocean from SARAL/AltiKa (red) and fitted with the \nOpen Ocean model (blue). \nIn coastal product we have provided three types of retrackers which are useful for the retrieval of \nparameters in the coastal region. These retrackers are discussed in the following sections. \n \n3.2.1 Beta retracker with exponential edge \nMartin et al. (1983) developed a retracking algorithm for processing altimeter waveforms over \ncontinental ice sheets.  This algorithm was used to retrack all SEASAT radar altimeter \nwaveforms. This retracker was found useful in many coastal studies eg. Deng (2003)  \n9 \n \nThe algorithm fits a 5 or 9-parameter function to the altimeter waveform. The first function is for \nfitting returns with single ramp in the trailing edge while the second one is used to fit returns \nwith double ramps in the trailing edge. Single-ramp returns are modeled by 5-parameter model \n(Figure 5). The functional form for which is given in the equation below: \nW(t) = β1 + β2(1 + β5Q)P(\nt-β3\nβ4 ) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3.3) \nwhere \nQ = {             0                          for  t < β3 + 0.5β4\nt - (β3 + 0.5β4)        for  t > β3 + 0.5β4  \n \n \n \n \n(3.4) \n                     𝑃(𝑥) = ∫\n1\n√2𝜋𝑒𝑥𝑝(\n−𝑞2\n2 ) 𝑑𝑞\n𝑥\n−∞\n \n                    \n \n     \n   \n \n(3.5) \nThe unknown parameters related to a waveform are: \n1) β1 : Thermal noise level of waveform \n2) β2 : Return signal amplitude \n3) β3 : Midpoint on the leading edge of the waveform \n4) β4 : Return waveform rise-time \n5) β5 : Slope of the trailing edge \nβ4 (the rise-time) is equivalent to 𝜎𝑐, the composite rise-time. The formula used to derive the \nSWH from the rise time is: \nσc\n2 = σp\n2 + (   \n2\nc σs )2  \n where c is speed of light \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3.6) \n𝑆𝑊𝐻 =  4𝜎𝑠  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n \n \nFigure 5. Cartoon showing different parameters in the 5 parameter BETA retracker. \nIn eqn. (3.6), 𝜎𝑐 is written instead of β4 to denote the composite rise-time. Please note that 𝜎𝑐        \nis composite rise time and is slightly different from 𝜎𝑠  which is RMS of surface elevation.   \nSimple form of eqn. 3.3 helps in encountering the contamination in the waveforms. \n9 parameter form of eqn. (3.3) is given as \nW(t) = β1 + β2(1 + β5Q1)P(\nt-β3\nβ4  )+ 𝛽6(1 + 𝛽9𝑄2)𝑃(\n𝑡−𝛽7\n𝛽8 )     \n \n \n(3.7) \nwhere 𝑃 is same as in eqn. 3.5 and  \n𝑄1 and 𝑄2 are analogous to eqn. 3.4 as \nQ1 = {             0                         for  t < β3 + 0.5β4\nt − (β3 + 0.5β4)        for  t > β3 + 0.5β4 \n \n     (3.8) \nQ2 = {             0                         for  t < β7 + 0.5β8\nt − (β7 + 0.5β8)        for  t > β7 + 0.5β8 \nwhere β6, β7, β8and  β9 are the parameters of the second ramp in the waveform.  \n1)  β6: Return signal amplitude of the second ramp \n2) β7 : Midpoint on the leading edge of second ramp in the waveform \n11 \n \n3) β8 :  Rise-time of the second ramp in the waveform \n4) β9 : Slope of the trailing edge of the second ramp in the waveform. \nVarious parameters in 9 parameter BETA retracker are shown in Figure 6. \n \nFigure 6. Cartoon showing different parameters in the 9 parameter BETA retracker. \nDeng and Featherstone (2006) gave a different expression than eq. (3.2) with exponential trailing \nedge for 5 parameters which is given as  \nW(t) = β1 + β2exp(-β5Q)P(\nt-β3\nβ4 ) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3.9) \nwhere 𝑃 is same as in eqn. 3.4 and  \nQ = {             0                      for  t < β3-2β4\nt - (β3 + 0.5β4)        for  t > β3-2β4 \n \n \n \n \n \n(3.10) \n9 parameter form of eqn. (3.9) is given as \nW(t) = β1+β2exp(-β5Q1)P ( \nt-β3\nβ4  )(t) + β6exp(-β9Q2)P( \nt-β7\nβ8  )    \n \n \n(3.11) \nwhere 𝑃 is same as in eqn. 3.5 and  \n12 \n \n𝑄1 and 𝑄2 are analogous to eqn. 3.10 as \n \nQ1 = {             0                         for  t < β3 −2β4\nt − (β3 + 0.5β4)        for  t > β3 −2β4  \n         (3.12) \n                                            Q2 = {             0                          for  t < β7 −2β8\nt − (β7 + 0.5β8)        for  t > β7 −2β8 \nBoth BETA5 (Equation 3.7) and BETA9 (Equation 3.11) have been used to generate coastal \nproducts.  Reasons for specifically using BETA5 and BETA9 retarckers is because \nSARAL/AltiKa has very low mispointing angle which gives an exponential form to trailing edge \nof the waveform. So the linear trailing edge is not an appropriate choice for retracking. The \nmethod used for fitting model to the waveform is an iterative non-linear fitting approach, which \nis the least squares method with appropriate weighing scheme (Deng, 2003). \nGeophysical parameters derived from the BETA retrackers are provided in the coastal product as \nper the following naming convention: \nFor 5 parameter BETA retracker \nSSHA                 ::     ssha_beta5_40hz \nSSH                    ::     ssh_beta5_40hz \nSWH                  ::     swh_beta5_40hz \nWIND SPEED  ::      wind_speed_beta5_40hz \nSimilarly, for  9 parameter BETA retracker \nSSHA                 ::     ssha_beta9_40hz \nSSH                    ::     ssh_beta9_40hz \nSWH                  ::     swh_beta9_40hz \nWIND SPEED  ::      wind_speed_beta9_40hz \n13 \n \n3.2.2 Brown with Asymmetric Gaussian Peak model (BAGP)  \nThis model adds the asymmetric Gaussian peak with the ocean type waveform in order to model \nthe waveforms in the coastal region. Halimi et al. (2013) gave a Brown + peak model and \nimplemented it by using MLE and Nelder-Mead unconstrained optimization method. The \nfunctional form of the model is given as: \n                                     𝑊(𝑡) = 𝑊𝑏(𝑡) + 𝑃𝑘(𝑡)   \n \n \n \n \n \n(3.11) \nWhere Wb(𝑡) is same as eq. 3.1 and the peak component Pk(𝑡) is given as  \n \n                                 𝑃𝑘(𝑡) = 𝐴𝑘 𝑒𝑥𝑝 [\n−1\n2𝜎𝑘\n2 (𝑡−𝑇𝑘)2] {𝛾[ \n(𝑡−𝑇𝑘)\n√2 ] }          \n \n \n(3.12) \n𝐴𝑘, 𝑇𝑘,  𝜎𝑘, and  𝛾 are amplitude, position, width and asymmetry coefficient of the peak \nrespectively.   \nTwo type of fitting methods for this algorithm, following Halimi et al. (2013), are provided. One \nfitting is done by the least square method while the other is using Nelder Mead (Nelder et al, \n1965) method of fitting. The latter will be referred to as BAGP (nm). \nThe geophysical parameters are provided as variables in the product as:  \nSSHA                 ::     ssha_bagp_40hz/ ssha_bagp_nm_40hz \nSSH                    ::     ssh_bagp_40hz/ ssh_bagp_nm_40hz \nSWH                  ::     swh_bagp_40hz/ swh_bagp_nm_40hz \nWIND SPEED  ::      wind_speed_bagp_40hz/ wind_speed_bagp_nm_40hz \n \n3.3 Other related parameters \nThese are some other parameters (not exactly geophysical products) related to retrackers that are \nimportant for inclusion in the product. They are described in the following sub-sections. \n14 \n \n3.3.1 Backscatter Coefficient \nBackscatter coefficient (Sigma(0)) is an important parameter for wind speed computation. This \nvariable is computed from each of the retrackers and are named as follows:   \nsigma_zero_mle4_40hz for MLE4 retracker \nsigma_zero _beta5_40hz for 5 parameter BETA retracker \nsigma_zero _beta9_40hz for 9 parameter BETA retracker \nsigma_zero _bagp_40hz for BAGP retracker \nsigma_zero _bagp_nm_40hz for BAGP (nm) retracker \n3.3.2 Quality flags for retrackers. \nThe retracking quality flags are provided in the coastal product in the following manner:  \nflag_mle4_40hz for MLE4 retracker \nflag_beta5_40hz for 5 parameter BETA retracker \nflag_beta9_40hz for 9 parameter BETA retracker \nflag_bagp_40hz for BAGP retracker \nflag_bagp_nm_40hz for BAGP (nm) retracker \nThis is a simple flag. Its value is zero if retracking has been performed.  \nNote: Users must note that sometimes the retracking is successful but the fitted waveforms \nstill do not fit the original waveforms. Therefore, an additional fitting quality parameter, \nmean quadratic error (MQE) is also provided. This parameter gives an idea about the \nerrors in fitting from various algorithms. \nMQE is mean squared difference between the observed waveforms and the fitted model. \nWaveform and model waveform power are normalized by the maximum power in waveforms.  \n𝑀𝑄𝐸=\n1\n𝑁∑\n(𝑤𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚(𝑖) −𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙(𝑖))2\n𝑖=1:𝑁\n  \n \n \n \n(3.13) \nN=128 for SARAL \n15 \n \nLesser the MQE better the retracking result. MQE also depends on the noise content in \nwaveforms and therefore relative MQE and the flags have to be checked before using the \ngeophysical parameter. \nmqe_mle4_40hz for MLE4 retracker \nmqe_beta5_40hz for 5 parameter BETA retracker \nmqe_beta9_40hz for 9 parameter BETA retracker \nmqe_bagp_40hz for BAGP retracker \nmqe_bagp_nm_40hz for BAGP (nm) retracker \nNote: It is suggested that the both retracking flags as well as MQE should be checked \nbefore using the geophysical parameters from any retracker. Users can set a threshold for \nMQE for using the data. \nThere is no rain flag in the SARAL data but an additional trailing_edge_variation_flag_40hz \nparameter is provided in the IGDR product. This flag accounts for the rain as well as presence of \ndense cloud as SARAL/AltiKa is more sensitive to water vapor than Ku-C dual frequency \naltimeters. Same flag has been provided in the product. \n \n4. Shape Classification of altimetric waveforms  \nDifferent type of shapes of waveforms other than the standard deep ocean type (Brown type) \nwaveforms are usually encountered in the coastal areas. The algorithms discussed in the Section \n3.2 were based on modeling the shapes of the coastal waveforms, so it becomes necessary to \nclassify the waveform based on predefined shape. In coastal product a linear discriminant \nanalysis (LDA) based technique was used to classify the waveforms on the basis of their shapes. \nAs shown in the Figure 7 there are different types of shape in which waveforms are classified. \nExplanation of these classes is given as follows: \nClass 1: Brown type waveforms; which are characteristic for deep ocean and follows Brown \nmodel. \n16 \n \nClass 2: Peak echoes; which are received due to high reflectance either due to still water \npresence or due to high reflection from land. \nClass 3: Very noisy type echoes; having a lot of noise and no shape feature is identified. \nClass 4: Peak at the end of echoes; found near land. \nClass 5: Brown + peaky echoes; these type along with class7 are received when both ocean and \nland exist in the footprint of altimeter. It is a mixed type of signal. \nClass 6: Linear; found near land or due to on-board tracker errors \nClass 7: Brown + peak on the trailing edge; described in class 5. \nClass 8: Peaky + Noise echoes; formed due to high reflectance from land in the footprint of \naltimeter.  \n \nFigure 7. Different classes of waveforms   \nClassification involves three steps: \n1) Feature selection   \n2) Dimensionality reduction by LDA \n3) Class assignment by Bayesian classifier \n17 \n \nMore details are provided in the Chaudhary et al. (2015). \nThe waveform class is provided as waveform_class variable in the product. In addition, original \nwaveforms from the S-IGDR product as waveforms are also provided. \nNote: It is suggested to users should not use the very noisy (Class 3), peak with noise (Class \n8), Peak at the end (Class 4) and Linear (Class 6) because they have very high noise or \ntracker failures \n \n5. Geophysical Corrections  \nThere are various geophysical corrections which need to be applied to the range measurements to \naccount for the signal delay. All these corrections are provided in the S-IGDR product as 1 Hz. \nThe same values have been interpolated at 40-Hz using cubic spline interpolation.  No specific \nprocessing of the corrections in this version of coastal product has been done.  However, for the \nsake of brevity, standard corrections provided in S-IGDR version for 1-Hz are listed below: \n1) Dry Tropospheric correction \nThis correction is due to the presence of the dry air medium between the satellite and the oceans \nwhich affects the velocity of propagation of the radio pulse. Its value is approx. -2.3 m and it \nvaries very less. European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) numerical \nweather prediction models are used to compute the surface pressure (Chelton et.al ,2001) and \nthen inverse barometer corrections. These values are provided in S-IGDR product. In the present \ncoastal product, the variable dry_tropo_model_interp_40hz represents the 40-Hz interpolated \ndry tropospheric corrections. \n2) Wet Tropospheric correction \nThis correction is due to the presence of water vapor and the liquid water. It is highly variable in \nthe atmosphere and many times the correction reaches up to 40 cm. It is corrected in the open \nocean by the use of onboard MWR at different frequencies. In the coastal areas, however, the \nradiometer itself is contaminated thus providing inaccurate corrections. Therefore, since the \npresent product is within 50 km, wet tropospheric corrections calculated from the ECMWF \n18 \n \nmodel is used. These corrections are once again interpolated to 40-Hz. It is provided as wet-\ntropo_model_interp_40hz in the product. \n3) Tidal corrections \nThere are three types of contributions to the tidal effect: \na) \nGeocentric Ocean tide  \nThis correction is taken from the original S-IDGR data, interpolated at 40-Hz and is provided as \ngeoc_ocean_tide_sol1_interp_40hz. It is calculated from GOT 4.8 Ocean Tide Model Ray \n(1999) \nb) \nSolid Earth tide \nThis correction is taken from the original S-IDGR data, interpolated at 40-Hz and is provided as \nsolid_earth_tide_interp_40hz. More details about this correction is provided in SARAL/AltiKa \nProduct Handbook (December, 2013).  \nc) \nPole tide \nThis correction is taken from the original S-IDGR data, interpolated at 40-Hz and is provided as \npole_tide_interp_40hz. It is calculated in IGDR as described in Wahr (1985). Users can refer \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook (December, 2013) for details about these corrections.  \n4) Sea state Bias corrections \nThis correction arises due to asymmetry of the reflecting properties of various scattering \nelements contributing for the average return. Troughs on the reflecting surface reflect better than \nthe crests which creates the bias of the measured heights towards the troughs. Also the \ninstrument measures the median rather than the mean scattering surface which creates an \nadditional error. The distribution of the reflecting elements on the surface is skewed rather than \nsymmetrical. This error is due to sea state and hence known as sea state bias. This is computed \nby empirical algorithms as described in Labroure (2004). This correction is provided as \nsea_state_bias_interp_40hz. \n \n19 \n \n5) Ionospheric Corrections \nThis correction arises due to slowing down of group velocity of radar pulse by the presence of \nfree electrons in the ionosphere. Ionospheric correction in Ka band altimeter is one order less \nthan Ku band altimeters. Dual frequency ionospheric correction is not possible in \nSARAL/AltiKa due to the absence of additional altimeter frequency. Therefore, external data are \nused to compute ionospheric correction.  Total Electron Content computed from GPS based \nobservations and ionosphere model (JPL GIM model) are used to account for this correction. \n6) Inverse Barometer Corrections \nThis correction corresponds to the change in sea level due to variations in atmospheric pressure \nvariations. Higher the pressure lower is the sea level. It is computed from the surface pressure \nvalues as provided by numerical prediction model (NWP) and dry tropospheric correction. In the \npresent version of the coastal product, it is provided as inv_barr_interp_40hz.   This correction \ngiven for 1-Hz data in S-IGDR has been once again interpolated to 40-Hz data.     \n7) High frequency fluctuation Corrections \nThis correction is ocean’s response to the wind and pressure and has energy at periods shorter \nthan 20 days. It is considered as the departure from the inverse barometers effect to pressure and \nadditionally wind effects. This correction is calculated by using specific models (SARAL/AltiKa \nProducts Handbook, 2013). These corrections are interpolated at 40-Hz and provided as \nhf_fluctuations_interp_40hz. More details about this correction are in Stammer et al. (1999) \nand Tierney et al. (2000). \n \n6. Mean Sea Surface, Geoid and Bathymetry \nIn order to compute the SSHA, MSS is required. SARAL/AltiKa S-IGDR product provides MSS \nfrom MSS_CNES_CLS11 model which is computed from 16 years of satellite altimetry data. 1-\nHz MSS data has been interpolated to 40-Hz.    \n20 \n \nThere are two different geoid provided in the product. One is geoid_interp_40hz which is \ninterpolated at 40-Hz from the EGM96 geopotential model (Lemoine et al., (1998)) provided in \nthe S-IGDR data. \nAnother one is geoid_sac, which is a high resolution geoid in the Indian Ocean (Sreejith et al., \n2013). \nBathymetry is provided in the product from Sindhu et al. (2007) which is made using Smith and \nSandwell, 2 minute bathymetry, ETOPO2v2, specifically corrected for the Indian Ocean region. \n \n7. Other parameters  \nSome other parameters are also provided as listed below: \n1) Geolocation: The geolocation is provided as longitude_40hz, latitude_40hz \n2) Time: Time of the observation is provided as seconds since 2000-01-01 00:00:00.0. It is \nprovided as time_40hz \n3) Distance from the coast:  This parameter is calculated from high resolution coastline created \nat Space Applications Centre (SAC).  It is provided as distance_from_coast_40hz \n4) Land Flag: This flag is calculated from high resolution coastline created at SAC. It is \nprovided as land_flag_40hz. \n \nNote: It is suggested that users check the retracking quality flags, mqe threshold, distance \nfrom the coast, waveform class, trailing edge variation flag and valid parameter range for \nfiltering out bad data values.   \n \n \n21 \n \nAppendix A:  List of Acronyms \nBAGP: \n Brown with Asymmetric Gaussian Peak   \nBAGP-NM:     Brown with Asymmetric Gaussian Peak – Nelder Mead \nCNES:             Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales \nECMWF:     \nEuropean Center for Medium range Weather Forecasting \nFFT:                Fast Fourier Transform \nGDR:               Geophysical Data Record \nI-GDR:            Interim Geophysical Data Record \nISRO:              Indian Space Research Organisation \nMSS:               Mean Sea Surface \nMWR:             Microwave Radiometer \nMLE:              Maximum Likelihood Estimator \nMQE:              Mean Quadratic Error \nNetCDF:         Network Common Data Format \nNWP:              Numerical Weather Prediction \nPOD:               Precision Orbit Determination \nRMS:              Root Mean Square \nSLA:               Sea Level Anomaly \nSAC:               Space Applications Centre \nS-IGDR:         Sensor Interim Geophysical Data Record \nSSHA:            Sea Surface Height Anomaly \nSSH:               Sea Surface Height \nSWH:             Significant Wave height \nSARAL:         Satellite with ARgos and AltiKa \nTEC:               Total Electron Content \n \n \n \n \n \n \n22 \n \nAppendix B: References \nAmarouche L, Thibaut P, Zanife O.-Z, Dumont, P.

Present method has been \nused separately for cold core and warm core eddies. \nThe important steps of the eddy detection and tracking method is explained below, \n1. Remove the long wavelength (consider 50-500 km scale) \n2. In a region that is defined by a set of connected pixels a pixel is interior to the region \nif it’s all the four neighbours (top, bottom, left and right) lie within the region.  \n3. An eddy is defined as a simply connected set of pixels. The closed contours Cc are \nsequentially identified and analysed.  \n4. Identifying outer most closed contour of SSH anomaly. \n5. For a closed contour Cc to be potentially defining an eddy, it must satisfy following \ncriteria: \n- \nAll the pixels interior to the region are above (below) a given SSH threshold for \nanticyclonic (cyclonic) eddies. \n- \nThe connected region should have at least 8 and maximum 1000 pixels.  \n- \nThere should not be more than one local maximum (minimum) of SSH for \nanticyclonic (cyclonic) eddies  \n- \nThe amplitude of eddy should be at least 1 cm. \n6. Eddy amplitude for anticyclonic eddy, A = hmax-ho and for cyclonic eddy, A = ho- \nhmin  \n7. For an anticyclonic (cyclonic) eddy, the eddy is identified first by getting the \nmaximum (minimum) value of SSH in the given eddy region enclosed within contour \nmarked in blue (Ceff).  \n8. With Ceff as the contour, area of the enclosed region is calculated by summing the \narea of individual pixels within the blue contour. \n9.  In the next step this area is used to calculate the radius of a circle.   \n10. With this radius one can get the outer contour of the circle (Ctrk) and new centre \n(Ptrk) of the eddy. The new centre Ptrk is used to track the eddies with sequential \nSSH anomalies maps.  \n11. Eddy at time t, only those with amplitude and area lying between 0.25 and 2.5 times \nthose of reference eddy are considered at time t+1.  \n12. The eddies which are not tracked in the next time step are considered to be dissipated.  \n13. The eddies were not present in the previous time step and have been detected in the \npresent image are the ones which are new born. \n \nFigure: Different steps of eddy detection and tracking from SLA \n \nWe have detected eddies using the combination of two sets of threshold for amplitude and size \nRegion \nAmplitude threshold (m) \nSize threshold(km) \nTropics ( 15oS to 15oN) \n0.02 \n600 \nOutside Tropics \n0.05 \n400 \n \n \nReferences \n Mason, E., Pascual, A., & McWilliams, J.

The H-E technique originally developed by NOAA/STAR for GOES is modified and \ncalibrated for Kalpana/INSAT satellite observations. The H-E method uses Kalpana/INSAT VHRR thermal \ninfrared (TIR) observations and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model based environmental \nparameters to make a quantitative assessment of the precipitation at each TIR pixel (~ 4km x 4 km for \nINSAT-3D/3R) in every acquisition of the satellite measurement (presently, 30 minutes for Kalpana/INSAT). \nIn H-E method, the rain at a pixel is determined by the cloud growth with respect to the surrounding pixels. \nThe H-E method ensures heavier rain for growing clouds and at the upwind portion with overshooting tops of \nthe storm. The rain at a pixel is the combination of rain from convective (core) and stratiform (non-core) \nportions of the clouds, which is determined by the vertical growth of the clouds at the pixel under \nconsideration with respect to surrounding pixels. The relationship between rain rate from core portion and \nbrightness temperature is exponential in nature with coefficients depend upon the available total columnar \nprecipitable water (TPW). Thus these coefficients are determined dynamically at each pixel for the given \nTPW from NWP model. The correction due to orography resulting in enhancement/reduction of rain; and the \ndetection and enhancement of rain from warm clouds are also applied to H-E rain. The orographic correction \nis carried out by determining average slope in the direction of the prevailing 850 mb winds, whereas \ncorrection for the warm clouds is determined by locating the level of neutral buoyancy (LNB) in the \natmosphere. Further correction for the evaporation of the rain drops below the cloud base using relative \nhumidity from the NWP model fields is applied. The H-E algorithm is found to show very low rain over high \nterrains, especially over the Himalayas. A thorough study of the H-E rain over Himalayas showed missing \nLNB computation (because of non-convergence) and inconsistent calculation of orographic gradients, \nespecially when surface pressure is below 850 mb. It is also noticed that NCEP model derived TPW and RH \nhave strong dry bias over Himalayas that resulted in drying of rain over such regions. In the modified \nalgorithm, the TPW and RH over Himalayas are adjusted using histograms of these parameters over Indian \nplanes using histogram equalization technique. For a given value of TPW/RH, the histogram equalization \nprovided same probability for rain over plane and hilly terrains, which, however, is further modified by \norographic and warm-cloud correction. In the modified algorithm, the 850 mb wind is replaced by winds \nabove the given surface pressure level at each steps of the computation of orographic correction. The LNB \ncalculation is also modified by considering given surface pressure as reference level for the computation \n(unlike 1000 mb level as the standard practice earlier). With these modifications, it is found that measurement \nof rain using H-E method improved significantly, especially over hilly terrains. \n \nThe intense rain events (> 10 mm/h) from the H-E derived rain rates are identified and their area extent and \ncentral coordinates are determined and provided in the tabular and pictorial form. Also the districts which \nexperience more than 5 mm/h rain are identified; their name and corresponding met-subdivision are provided \nin another table. The H-E rain over the land as well as over the oceans are available from MOSDAC in HDF5 \nformat. However, the intense rain events shown here are provided only over the Indian landmass. The H-E \nmethod depends upon brightness temperature in satellite thermal infrared observations and NWP model \nfields. The thermal infrared observations sense only the cloud top and hence their use for rain measurement is \nessentially indirect in nature. Also the infrared based methods have well known weakness for warm and \norographic rain. Though H-E offers corrections for orographic and warm rain, the accuracy of the method \nstill depends upon the accuracy of the input dataset, especially the NWP fields. \nContact person for algorithm related queries: \nDr. Atul Kumar Varma \nSAC/ISRO, Ahmedabad \navarma@sac.isro.gov.in \n", "tokens": 929}

CAM version 3 is one of the latest Atmosphere \nGeneral Circulation Model (AGCM) that has been made available to the scientific community, \noriginating from NCAR Community Climate Model. It is also the atmospheric component of the \nCommunity Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3), which is a fully coupled model. CAM3 \nincorporates a significant modification from its earlier version to the dynamical formulation and \nthe treatment of cloud and precipitation processes, radiation processes and atmospheric aerosols. \nThe standard version of CAM3 is based upon the Eulerian spectral dynamical core with \ntriangular spectral truncation at 31, 42, and 85 wave-numbers. The zonal resolution at the \nequator ranges from 3.75° to 1.41° for the T31 and T85 configurations. The vertical dimension is \ntreated using 26 levels with a hybrid terrain-following coordinate. The vertical grid transitions \nfrom a pure sigma region in the lowest layer through a hybrid sigma–pressure region to a pure \npressure region above approximately 83 mbar. \nThe land component of CAM, named Community Land Model (CLM), interacts with \natmosphere at every 10 model-minutes and exchange required surface fluxes. The land model is \ncoupled with CAM3 and integrated on the same horizontal grid as the atmosphere, although each \ngrid box is further divided into a hierarchy of land units, soil columns, and plant functional types \n(PFT). There are 10 sub-surface soil layers and up to five snow layers depending on the snow \ndepth in CLM. Land units represent the largest spatial patterns of sub-grid heterogeneity and \ninclude glaciers, lakes, wetlands, urban areas, and vegetated regions. The different surface data \nfor each land grid cell are glacier, lake, wetland, and urban portions of the grid cell; the fractional \ncover of the four most abundant PFTs in the vegetated portion of the grid cell; monthly leaf and \nstem area index and canopy top and bottom heights for each PFT; and soil color and soil texture. \nThese fields are taken from the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP) land surface \ndatasets and interpolated to model grid from high resolution data sets. To characterize the mean \nfeatures of the simulated parameters, the model is integrated at T85L26 using observed SST and \nobserved sea ice. In this resolution, the model has a horizontal resolution of ~1.4° and 26 \nunequal vertical sigma levels. \nInitially, the model capability in capturing the variability of ISM rainfall has been examined for \nseveral years. Firstly, the model climatology has been generated in T85 resolution over the \nextended Indian monsoon region through 60-years of long-term model simulation (1951 – 2010) \nand analyzed with different sets of observed climatology. Consequently, a bias correction \ntechnique has been implemented and applied on the model simulated rainfall to correct the model \nbiases on monthly as well as daily scale. Finally, the model has been tested for the seasonal \nforecast of ISM for several years (2010 to 2014) on experimental mode. The results of the \nextensive validations carried out for all the forecasts made during 2010-2014 have encouraged us \nto make the forecast on regular basis but on experimental mode. \nThe seasonal prediction of ISM rainfall for the year 2015 will be carried out in T85 \n(~1.41°×1.41°) horizontal model resolution for the duration of June to September (JJAS) and \nwill be issued in May 2015. The seasonal accumulated rainfall, monthly mean rain-rate and time \nseries of pentad rain-rate averaged over Indian landmass will be estimated using ensemble mean \napproach of large number of CAM simulations, each started from different initial conditions. The \nmonthly and seasonal forecast will be updated on monthly basis. Further, weekly accumulated \nrainfall for the upcoming four weeks will also be predicted by the ensemble CAM model that \nwill start from June 1, 2015 onwards and updated on weekly basis. Weekly and monthly \nvalidation of the forecast will also be conducted on regular basis using IMD observations. \n \nReferences: \n• Das S K, Deb S K, Kishtawal C M and Pal P K (2015), Validation of seasonal forecast of \nIndian summer monsoon rainfall, Pure and Applied Geophysics, January 2015, DOI \n10.1007/s00024-014-1024-3. \n• Das S K, Deb S K, Kishtawal C M and Pal P K (2014), Sensitivity of initial conditions on \ndiurnal variability of Indian Summer Monsoon, Pure and Applied Geophysics, November \n2014, DOI 10.1007/s00024-014-0944-2. \n• Das S K, Deb S K, Kishtawal C M and Pal P K (2013), Seasonal prediction of Indian \nsummer monsoon: Sensitivity to persistent SST, J.

These \n2-D structures have an ability to facilitate or block the material transport (of seawater + passive \ntracers) through them, thus organizing the flow pattern of passive tracers in the ocean. Its \ncomputation involves the 2-D advection of particles (starting from a well-defined grid) at a current \ntime with altimeter velocities to a certain period of time (15 days in this case). Details can be found \nin Farazmand et al. 2012 and Onu et al. 2015. If the advection is carried out backward in time, \nthen we can calculate the `attracting LCS`. These attracting LCS’s form the flow pattern of the \npassive tracer. These LCS’s can be termed as ‘skeleton of flows’ for a passive tracer. Passive tracer \ncan be a Lagrangian float near surface, Oil Spills, Chlorophyll, occasionally SST and Salinity. \nLCS-Cores are the strongest of the LCS and these will last longer in time relative to other LCS’s. \nLCS-Cores strongly affect the passive tracers over a larger period to time. Typical time-scale of \nthese LCS-Cores can be few days. Details of computation of LCS-Cores can be found in Olascoaga \net al. 2012. Strength of the LCS-Core is determined by the average lagrangian strain-rate (unitless \nquantity). These LCS Cores form fingering type instabilities along the stretching directions for \nan oil spill patch as illustrated in the below graphic. Other LCSs also affect the oil spill patch \nshapes but the LCS Cores are the most prominent among them.  \n \nFigure 1. Illustration of stretching of an oil-patch if it happens to be on the LCS Core. This is a \nfingering type instability. \nIn the GUI, we have presented the LCS-Cores. These have been calculated form the altimeter \nvelocity field. Duration of advection is 15 days. \nLCS- Cores are shown as Scattered points in the plots.  The color coding shows their strength \n(unit-less). \nStretching directions \nAs discussed in the previous section, the stretching directions are the directions associated with \nthe LCS-Core. It is computed as the eigenvectors of the Cauchy-Green Tensor obtained through \nadvection of particles. In physical sense, it means the direction of maximum relative stretching. \nFigure 1 shows the impact of stretching directions.  We expect the passive tracers to align to these \ndirections. \nIn the GUI, the arrow direction corresponds to the stretching direction of the LCS.  \nBackground Field – FiniteTime Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) \nThis scalar quantity is an intermediate field coming in calculation of LCS and LCS-Cores. This is \na quantity that characterizes the rate of separation of infinitely close trajectories (of advected \nparticles backward in time). Higher values signify relatively larger rate of separation than its \nneighboring locations. It is computed by advecting the particles for a particular time (15 days in \nthis case) and finding the highest eigenvalue of the Cauchy green tensor that arise from advection. \nDetails of computation can be found in Farazmand et al. 2012. \nRidges of FTLE forms generally contains LCS although it is not the sufficient condition. But it \nprovides a nice picture of the overall structures present in the ocean arising from velocity field for \na particular day. \n \nFigure 2. Backward time FTLE filed for a particular day (4th March 2016) in the Bay of Bengal \ncalculated using the altimeter velocity field. \nIn the GUI, background is the FTLE field in (day -1).

Figure 10 and Figure 11 show the \ndifferent layers for Gulf Stream region of ocean. \n \nFigure 8.  Global FTLE layer of GUI at MOSDAC \n \nFigure 9. Global FTLE + LCS Cores layer of GUI at MOSDAC \n \n \n \nFigure 10. Gulf Stream FTLE layer of GUI at MOSDAC \n \n \nFigure 11. Gulf Stream FTLE + LCS Cores layer of GUI at MOSDAC \n \nInterpretation of GUI \nFTLE Layer: FTLE layer is a two dimensional field that contains the LCS within and forms a \ncontiguous field that effects the passive tracers like oil-spills, Chlorophyll and occasionally \nSST/SSS, red tides, etc. FTLE aligns with SST/Chlorophyll gradient fields. \n \nFigure 12.  Snapshot of FTLE layer of GUI at MOSDAC \nLCS layer: As discussed in section 2.5 LCS layer are curves (ref. black curves Figure 13) that \nhave a strong impact on the trajectories of the passive tracers. LCS layer is a stronger indicator \nthan the FTLE field.  \n \nFigure 13.  Snapshot of FTLE layer (background) + LCS layer (black curves) of GUI at \nMOSDAC \n \n \nLCS Core layer: As discussed in section 2.2 LCS-Core regions are the strongest of LCS regions \n(ref. colored scatter in Figure 14); Their strength is indicated in color-code with Red color \nindicating relatively higher strength and Blue color representing relatively weaker  LCS-Cores.  \nLCS-Cores are even a stronger indicator than LCS and have a predictive capability of few days \n(Olascoaga and Haller 2012). LCS have relatively lesser predictive capability than LCS. \n \nFigure 14.  Snapshot of FTLE layer (background) + LCS layer (black curves) + LCS-Cores \n(colored scatter)  of GUI at MOSDAC \nLCS Stretching directions:  Stretching directions (ref. white vectors Figure 15) will provide the \npreferred directions of advection/stretching for passive tracers near the LCS-Core regions. \n \nFigure 15. Snapshot of FTLE layer (background) + LCS layer (black curves) + Stretching \ndirections layer of GUI at MOSDAC  \n \nSummarizing, in terms of impact on the passive trajectories/fields the orders is shown as:  \nFTLE < LCS < LCS-Cores \nLCS-Cores have the most predictive capability for nowcasting trajectories of passive tracers. \nThese GUI can be a helpful tool for analyzing and predicting the fields as well as problems \nwhere surface advection plays an important role in trajectory/field evolution. \n1) Oil-spill trajectory nowcasting   \n2) Chlorophyll field (formation and evolution) \n3) SST field (formation and evolution) \n4) Red Tides (formation and evolution) \n5) Trajectory planning in the Ocean \n6) Waste Disposal problems in the ocean \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNewly Added Component (December 2023): \nOil Spill trajectory forecast tool \n This tool provides oil spill trajectory forecast over user provided area for next 5 days \n Uses Lagrangian method for forecasting oil-spill trajectories. \n User defined lateral diffusion value can be provided \n Uses numerical model data assimilated with satellite and in-situ data \nFor forecasting of oil-spill trajectories over time, a user-friendly tool has been developed. This tool \nis intended to provide a quick capability for the user to forecast oil-spill trajectory over next 5 \ndays. This tool uses numerical model surface forecast currents data. This numerical model is \nassimilated with satellite and in-situ data and operational at Space Applications Centre. Users can \nprovide oil-spill area and date from past 15 days. User provided oil-spill area is seeded with the \nparticles and the lagrangian particle trajectories are computed based on the surface currents and \nuser defined lateral diffusion values. Future trajectories are also displayed over the future time-\nsteps conveniently through GUI. \n \nThis new GUI tool is shown in Figure 16 (left side of GUI) and highlighted in red box  \n \nFigure 16: Oil-Spill trajectory forecasting tool in the GUI. \n \n \n \n \nUsers can enter the desired area using the following steps: \nStep 1: Insert desired polygon  \n \n \n \nStep 2: Insert the desired diffusion value in m2/sec  \n \n \n \nStep 3: Insert the submit button \n \n \n \nStep 4: Get the forecasted oil-spill trajectories over different time-steps using arrow keys: \n(Users can browse through various time-steps using the arrow keys) \n \n \n \nStep 5: Reset and clear the GUI \n \n \n \nReferences \nOlascoaga, Marı́a J., and George Haller. 2012. \"Forecasting sudden changes in environmental \npollution patterns.\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (National Acad \nSciences). doi:10.1073/pnas.1118574109. \nOnu, K., Florian Huhn, and George Haller. 2015. \"LCS Tool: A computational platform for \nLagrangian coherent structures.\" Journal of Computational Science (Elsevier) 7: 26-36. \ndoi:10.1016/j.jocs.2014.12.0012. \nFarazmand, Mohammad, and George Haller. 2012. \"Computing Lagrangian coherent structures \nfrom their variational theory.\" Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science \n(AIP) 22: 013128. doi:10.1063/1.3690153. \n", "tokens": 2670}

Chapters 3 to 21 contain \nthe theoretical basis for the individual algorithms of various geophysical parameters except \nHSCAS and tropical cyclone. Algorithms for tropical cyclone position and intensity \nestimation system and snow analysis system are to be written jointly with IMD because \nderivation of these parameters needs large number of auxillary inputs and operational \nmeterological expertise. Discussion is going on with IMD for making these two algorithms. \n \nThe purpose of this document is to describe the scientific algorithms which will be used to \nextract the Meteorological Products from the pre-processed Level 1 image data acquired by \nthe Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR) and 19 channel Sounder onboard INSAT-3D \nsatellite. VHRR produces images in six spectral channels, in the Visible (VIS), Near Infra-\nred (NIR), Mid Wave Infra-Red (MWIR), and Infra-Red (IR) part of the spectrum covering \nthe following channels: VIS 0.6μm, NIR 1.6μm, MWIR 3.9μm, WV 6.7μm, IR 10.8μm, IR \n12.0μm. Each channel of the Imager has different resolution as mentioned in the following \nTable-1 \n \nTable – 1: INSAT-3D VHRR Specification \n \nChannel No \nWavelength (m) \nResolution (Km) \n                     1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n0.55 - 0.75 \n1.55 - 1.70 \n3.8 - 4.0 \n6.5 - 7.1 \n1 \n1 \n4 \n8 \n5 \n10.2 - 11.3 \n4 \n6 \n11.5 - 12.5 \n4 \n \n  \n  \n \nINSAT-3D Sounder has 18 infrared channel and a visible channel to help cloud detection \nduring daytime.

Clouds are generally characterized by higher reflectance and lower \ntemperature than the underlying earth surface. As such, simple visible and infrared window \nthreshold approaches offer considerable skill in cloud detection. However, there are many \nsurface conditions when this characterization of clouds is inappropriate, most notably over \nsnow and ice. Additionally, some cloud types such as thin cirrus, low stratus at night, and small \ncumulus are difficult to detect because of insufficient contrast with the surface radiance. Cloud \nedges cause further difficulty since the instrument field of view will not always be completely \ncloudy or clear.  \nINSAT-3D VHRR will measure radiances in one visible and one SWIR band at 1 km spatial \nresolution, one MIR and two TIR bands at 4 km resolution, and one WV band at 8 km \nresolution. Radiances from 3 IR spectral bands TIR –1 , TIR –2 and MIR (Table 1) which are \nof same resolution of 4km are used in the INSAT cloud mask algorithm to estimate whether a \ngiven view of the earth surface is unobstructed by clouds. \nThis cloud mask parameter will be directly used for the retrieval of the following parameters:  \nSST , UTH, Fire and Snow Cover. This will be partially used for retrieval of AOD where \nadditional test may be required with the visible data. \n \n2.2.1 Overview and background \nThe INSAT cloud mask algorithm benefits from several previous efforts to characterize global \ncloud cover using satellite observations. These algorithms have been used in global cloud \nclimatology over long time periods and thus have overcome some of the difficulties facing the \nINSAT cloud mask algorithm. A wide variety of scientists have discussed the physical basis \nbehind each of the spectral tests and applications to satellite or aircraft data are present in a \nvariety of publications (Ackerman et al. [1997]. The INSAT cloud mask algorithm builds on \nthese past works by combining the different tests into a single unified algorithm. \nOperational GOES products by NESDIS also require cloud detection, an algorithm referred \nto as “cloud clearing.” In this application, an array of n×n contiguous pixels is categorized as \nclear, cloudy or unusable. The clear arrays are subcategorized as truly clear and clear/cloudy. \nCloud Mask \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n17\nIn an approach similar to the ITPP-5 method (Minnis et al 1995), clear conditions are \ndetermined based on brightness thresholds, difference thresholds, and comparison of \nobservations with first guess profiles.  \n \n2.2.2 Objective \nThe objective of this algorithm is to discriminate the cloudy pixels from the clear pixel in the \nimage data. \n2.3 \nInputs \n2.3.1 Static Data  \nParameter \nResolution \nAccuracy \nSource \nLand sea mask \n4 km \n \n- \nUSGS file (Available) \n \n \n2.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) \nNote: \nThe BTmax (11µ) for each time, user defined no. of previous days (default 20 days) \nimages of TIR –1 and TIR-2 for all times of the day will be needed.

The new concept included here is to determine the threshold on the \nbasis of clear sky temperature determined by compositing the multi-date image data. \n \n2.4.1.1 Theoretical Background \nThe theoretical basis of the algorithms and practical considerations are contained in this \nsection. For nomenclature, we shall refer to the infrared radiance as brightness temperature \n(equivalent blackbody temperature determined using the Planck function) denoted as BT. \nSubscripts refer to the wavelength at which the measurement is made.  \n \nClouds are generally characterized by higher reflectance and lower temperature than the \nunderlying earth surface. Simple visible and infrared window threshold approaches offer \nconsiderable skill in cloud detection; however, many surface conditions reduce cloud surface \ncontrast in certain spectral regions, (e.g. bright clouds over snow and ice). \n \n2.4.1.2 Infrared Brightness Temperature Thresholds and Difference (BTD) Tests  \nThe azimuthally averaged form of the infrared radiative transfer equation is given by  \n                 (1)  \nIn addition to atmospheric structure, which determines B(T), the parameters describing the \ntransfer of radiation through the atmosphere are the single scattering albedo, ω0 = σsca/σext, \nwhich ranges between 1 for a non-absorbing medium and 0 for a medium that absorbs and \ndoes not scatter energy, the optical depth, δ, and the Phase function, P(µ, µ′), which describes \nthe direction of the scattered energy.  \nTo gain insight on the issue of detecting clouds using IR observations from satellites, it is \nuseful to first consider the two-stream solution . Using the discrete-ordinates approach (Liou \n1973; Stamnes and Swanson 1981), the solution for the upward radiance from the top of a \nuniform single cloud layer is:  \n \n                Iobs = M–L–exp(–kδ) + M+L+ + B(Tc),                                (2) \n          \n \nwhere \nI↓ is the downward radiance (assumed isotropic) incident on the top of the cloud layer, I↑ the \nupward radiance at the base of the layer, and g the asymmetry parameter. Tc is a \nrepresentative temperature of the cloud layer.  \n  \nCloud Mask \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n19\nA challenge in cloud masking is detecting thin clouds. Assuming a thin cloud layer, the \neffective transmittance (ratio of the radiance exiting the layer to that incident on the base) is \nderived from equation (2) by expanding the exponential. The effective transmittance is a \nfunction of the ratio of I↓/I↑ and B(Tc)/I↑. Using atmospheric window regions for cloud \ndetection minimizes the I↓/I↑ term and maximizes the B(Tc)/I↑ term. Figure 3 is a simulation \nof differences in brightness temperature between clear and cloudy sky conditions using the \nsimplified set of equations . In these simulations, there is no atmosphere, the surface is \nemitting at a blackbody temperature of 290 K, the cloud particles are ice spheres with a \ngamma size distribution assuming an effective radius of 10 μm, and the cloud optical depth δ \n= 0.1. Two cloud temperatures are simulated (210 K and 250 K). Brightness temperature \ndifferences between the clear and cloudy sky are caused by non-linearity of the Planck \nfunction and spectral variation in the single scattering properties of the cloud. This figure \ndoes not include the absorption and emission of atmospheric gases, which would also \ncontribute to brightness temperature differences. Observations of brightness temperature \ndifferences at two or more wavelengths can help separate the atmospheric signal from the \ncloud effect.  \n \n \nFigure 3: A simple simulation of the brightness temperature differences between a “clear” \nand cloudy sky as a function of wavelength. The underlying temperature is 290 K and the \ncloud optical depth is 0.1. All computations assume ice spheres with re = 10 µm.   \n \n2.4.1.3 Methodology \nThe basis of our methodology is, first to generate a  clear composite of the maximum \nbrightness temperature in thermal channels to get rough idea about the surface temperature in \nthe clear sky condition at a particular time. Here assumption is that any pixel in the image \nwill not be covered by cloud continuously at a particular time for several (user defined no.) \ndays and the maximum brightness temperature will represent the clear sky background \ntemperature of that location. This will be the reference background temperature on which the \nthreshold for a particular location will be determined to discriminate cloud.  \nFirst step : Generation of  BTmax \n         BTmax = max (BT11 of each time of previous several (user defined no.) days) \nDefault number of days for clear composite image is 20. \nCloud Mask \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n20\n \nSIMPLE BT THRESHOLD TEST \nSeveral infrared window threshold and temperature difference techniques have been \ndeveloped. These algorithms are most effective for cold clouds over water and must be used \nwith caution in other situations. The first infrared test to apply  is a simple threshold test. \nWhen the brightness temperature in the 11 μm (BT11) channel  is less by some threshold \nvalue  than the maximum BT at that location, we assume the pixel to fail the clear-sky \ncondition, because the change in BT will not be more than these  due to change in other \natmospheric condition.This was determined by some radiative transfer simulation for \ndifferent atmospheric condition. This test gives a first set of cloudy pixels in the image. \n \nSecond step : First set of cloudy pixels \nOver land : \nIf  (BTmax – BT11 ) > 12 K , then  Cloudflag =1    ( Cloudy pixels) \nOver ocean : \nIf  (BTmax – BT11 ) > 6 K , then  Cloudflag =1    ( Cloudy pixels) \n \nThird step : First set of clear pixels. \nIf  abs(BTmax – BT11 ) < 2 K, then Cloudflag = 0   (Clear sky pixel) \n \nFor rest of the points   Cloudflag = 9    ( For further test ) \nFor points with Cloudflag = 9 , \n \nSOLAR ZENITH ANGLE CALCULATION \nSolar zenith angle has to be calculated for determining the day / night condition of the pixel.   \nSolar zenith angle (s) : \ns (in radian) = /2 – ASIN((SIN SIN(latitude)) + COS COS(latitude) COSH)       (1) \n (in radian) = solar declination angle = 0.39785SIN(4.869 + 0.0172cday +  \n                                             0.03345SIN(6.224+0.0172cday)) \n              \n    (2) \nH = sun hour angle at time ,‘t’ (in IST hrs.), in a calender day (cday) \n \n            IF (t GT 12)  AND (longitude GT 82.5)  THEN \n                                    H = t1 + L \n \n \n \n \n \n                (3) \nOtherwise, \n           IF ((t  LT 12) AND (longitude LT 82.5))  THEN \n                                   H = t1 + L \n \n \n \n \n \n                (4) \n                   Otherwise, \n                                  H = t1 – L \n \n \n \n \n \n                (5) \nWhere, \n      L = ABS(longitude – 82.5) \n \n \n \n \n \n                (6) \n      t1 = 15(ABS(12-t)) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                (7) \n \nIf the solar zenith angle > 86.5 º  \n \nThen pixel is considered to be falling in the night time. \nelse \n  Pixel is in the day time. \nCloud Mask \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n21\nBT11 - BT3.9 TEST (For points with Cloudflag = 9 ) \nChannel (3.9 μm) measures radiances in the window region near 3.8-4 μm so that the \ndifference between BT11 and BT3.9 can be used to detect the presence of clouds. At night the \ndifference between the brightness temperatures measured in the shortwave (3.9 μm) and in \nthe longwave (11 μm) window regions (BT11 – BT3.9) can be used to detect partial cloud or \nthin cloud within the INSAT field of view. Small or negative differences are observed only \nfor the case where an opaque scene (such as thick cloud or the surface) fills the field of view \nof the sensor. Negative differences occur at night over extended clouds due to the lower \ncloud emissivity at 3.9 μm.  \nDuring the daylight hours the difference between BT11 and BT3.9 is large and negative \nbecause of reflection of solar energy at 3.9 μm. This technique is very successful at detecting \nlow-level water clouds.  \nModerate to large differences between BT11 and BT3.9 result when a nonuniform scene (e.g., \nbroken cloud) is observed. The different spectral response to a scene of non-uniform \ntemperature is a result of Planck’s law. The brightness temperature dependence on the \nwarmer portion of the scene increasing with decreasing wavelength (the shortwave window \nPlanck radiance is proportional to temperature to the thirteenth power, while the longwave \ndependence is to the fourth power). Differences in the brightness temperatures of the \nlongwave and shortwave channels are small when viewing mostly clear or mostly cloudy \nscenes; however, for intermediate situations the differences become large (greater than 3°C). \nTable 2 lists examples of the thresholds as used in MODIS  algorithm.  We have used similar \nthresholds as used in MODIS algorithm. \nThe application of BT11 – BT3.9 is difficult in deserts during daytime. Bright desert \nregions with highly variable emissivities tend to be incorrectly classified as cloudy with this \ntest. The problem is mitigated somewhat in the  cloud mask by making use of a double-sided \ntest where brightness temperature differences greater than a \"low\" threshold but less than a \n\"high\" threshold are labeled clear while values outside this range are called cloudy. The \nthresholds are listed in Table 2. This threshold strategy along with the use of clear-sky \nrestoral tests is effective for detecting low-level clouds over deserts.  We are leaving these \nregions as undetermined if it is failing other tests. \nDetecting clouds at high latitudes using infrared window is a challenging problem due to the \ncold surface temperatures. Yamanouchi et al. (1987) describe a nighttime polar (Antarctic) \ncloud/surface discrimination algorithm based upon brightness temperature differences \nbetween the AVHRR 3.7 and 11 μm channels and between the 11 and 12 μm channels.   We \nare not attempting at those regions because data at such large angle of view is not very useful \nand not used for any parameter retrieval. \n    Table 2: Thresholds used for BT11 – BT3.9 test for low clouds are same as in the MODIS \ncloud mask algorithm.  \n.Scene Type  \nThreshold  \nHigh confidence clear  Low confidence \nclear  \nDay ocean  \n-8 .0 K  \n-6.0 K  \n-1 0.0 K  \nNight ocean  \n0.0 K  \n-1.0 K  \n1.0 K  \nDay land  \n-12.0 K  \n-10.0 K  \n-14. 0 K  \nCloud Mask \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n22\nBT3.7 - BT12 TEST  \nThis window brightness temperature difference test is applied during the nighttime over some, \nbut not all, surfaces. This difference is useful for separating thin cirrus and cloud free \ncondition and is relatively insensitive to the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere \n(Hutchison and Hardy 1995). This test is executed over land at night. The three thresholds for \nMODIS algorithm are 15, 10, and 5 K, for low confidence, mid-point, and high confidence, \nrespectively. Over snow-covered surfaces, the thresholds are 4.50, 4.00, and 3.50K. We shall \nbe using only the high confidence thresholds. \n \nNIGHT OCEAN SPATIAL VARIABILITY TEST   \nThe standard deviation of 3x3 arrays of 11 μm brightness temperatures centered on the pixels \nof interest is calculated for ocean scenes at night. The clear-sky ocean surface is usually very \nuniform over regions of this size and, in general, the presence of clouds increases the \nvariability. The thresholds for MODIS algorithm are 0.2K, 0.1K, and 0.05K for low, mid-\npoint, and high confidences, respectively. The reader will note that these values are very \nrestrictive, yet some very uniform low clouds are not detected by this test. For INSAT, we \nare using threshold of 0.05 K. \nIf the Standard deviation   in 3 x 3 array of BT11 is less 0.05 then the pixel is a clear sky \npixel. \n If    < 0.05 then cloudflag = 0 for the center pixel. \n \nSPATIAL UNIFORMITY TEST \nThe previous test is applied only over the ocean. Spatial Uniformity  test is applied to all \npixels. The standard deviation , Tmean and Tmaxmean  of the 3 x 3 array for the 11 μm \nbrightness temperatures centerd on the pixel of interest is computed.  \nIf the | Tmaxmean  -   Tmean  |     ≤  2.0 and  <  1.5 then for the center pixel,  cloud flag = 0. \nOver Land , \nIf (Tmean    - Tmaxmean ) ≤   –12.0 K  and  < 1.5 then for the center pixel,  cloud flag = 1. \nOver Ocean,  \nIf (Tmean    - Tmaxmean ) ≤   –6.0 K  and  < 1.5 then for the center pixel,  cloud flag = 1. \n \nADJACENT PIXEL TEST \nAfter all the above tests , for the remaining pixel, where cloudflag = 9, in the 3 x 3 array of \nthe 11 μm brightness temperatures, find the number of cloudy (n1) and clear (n2) pixels. \nIf n1 > 5 then for the center pixel cloudflag = 1 \nIf n2 > 5 then for the center pixel cloudflag = 0 \n \nTEMPORAL UNIFORMITY TEST \nThe remaining pixels with cloudflag 9 are compared with the pixels of previous hour image. \nIf the difference in BT11 is less than 1K then  it is assumed that the atmospheric condition \nover that pixel has not changed much from the previous hour and the cloudflag of that pixel \nfrom previous hour is carried over to the current data \nIf  | BT11 (current image) – BT11 (previous hour image) | ≤ 1 K then   \n   Cloudflag (current) = cloudflag (previous) \n. \nFINAL THRESHOLD TEST \nCloud Mask \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n23\nFor remaining uncertain points (cloudflag = 9) final threshold test is done to assign probably \nclear or cloudy flag to each pixel.

Besides the broadband instruments that are dedicated for observing the OLR, for \nexample, Cloud and Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES), there are many algorithms \nthat estimate OLR by converting the narrowband radiances into broadband flux (OLR; \nEllingson et al. 1989, Ellingson et al. 1994, Singh et al., 2007, Sun et al., 2010).  Algorithm \nto estimate the OLR from the Geostationary Indian National Satellite (INSAT-3D) imager \nobserved WV (6.5 – 7.1 µm) and thermal infrared (TIR-1; 10.3 – 11.3 µm and TIR-2; 11.5 – \n12.5 µm) radiances has been developed in the frame of the IMDPS. The developed algorithm \nwill be used operationally when data from the INSAT-3D satellite will be available. \nAlgorithm to estimate the OLR is developed using two basic approaches: \n \ni. \nIn the first approach, a large database of spectral radiance fields and broadband flux \n(OLR) built using Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) is used to develop \nthe algorithm. The radiative transfer computations are performed at 19400 \nwavelengths covering the thermal region (4–100 m) and for 4704 realistic \nconditions of the Earth–atmosphere system.  \n \nii. \nIn the second approach, INSAT-3D imager radiances collocated (in space and time) \nwith CERES OLR available from Terra and Aqua satellites, are used to develop the \nalgorithm.   \nOutgoing longwave radiation \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n31\n3.2.1 Overview and background \nThe earth and its atmosphere absorb the shortwave (SW) radiation coming from the sun and \nemit thermal longwave (LW) radiation to space. These two radiation streams can be \nrepresented approximately by blackbody radiation of 6000K for the solar SW and 290K for \nthe terrestrial (LW). The balance between the incoming SW radiation and the LW determines \nthe temperature in the atmosphere and on the earth’s surface. Outgoing longwave radiation \n(OLR) is the emission to space of terrestrial radiation (LW) from the top of the earth's \natmosphere.  OLR is strongly controlled by three main meteorological variables, namely the \ntemperature of the earth and the atmosphere above it, the presence of water vapor in the \natmosphere (which strongly absorbs infra-red radiation attenuating the terrestrial signal) and \nthe presence of clouds (which may completely block all outgoing infra-red radiation from the \nsurface). Thus, OLR reveal information on the temperature, humidity and cloudiness of the \natmosphere. Allan et al. (1999) state that changes in humidity in the mid-troposphere (400 to \n700 hPa) are most important in explaining clear-sky OLR variations.  \nThe estimates of outgoing longwave radiation, both operational and experimental \nhave been particularly useful for variety of problems in climate sensitivity and diagnostics \n(e.g., Schmetz and Liu, 1988), numerical weather forecasting and climate models. The OLR \nhas been used traditionally for radiation budget studies of the earth-atmosphere system. The \ntop of the atmosphere radiative energy balance between net incoming solar radiation and \nOLR is crucial in determining the large-scale atmospheric circulation and, therefore, the \nsynoptic evolution that is important for weather and climate prediction. OLR is a major \ncomponent of the Earth’s Radiation Budget, which drives the atmospheric circulation, \nparticularly over the tropics. This is mainly due to the fact that in the tropics, the OLR is \nlargely modulated by cloudiness. In particular, it varies with cloud top temperature and \nconsequently, low radiation values indicate the major convective system. Generally, values \nless than 250 Wm-2 would give a good indication of the cloudiness over the tropics. \nThe observations of OLR by earth orbiting satellites have been made from the \nbeginning of the environmental satellite program. Besides the broadband instruments that are \ndedicated for observing the OLR, for example, Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE), \nScanner Radiometer for Radiation Budget (ScaRab), and Cloud and Earth’s Radiant Energy \nSystem (CERES), there are many algorithms that estimate OLR by converting the \nnarrowband radiance observations into broadband flux (4–100 µm). The OLR was routinely \nobtained from the 10–12 µm window on operational National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration (NOAA) polar-orbiting satellite beginning in 1974 (Gruber and Winston, \n1978). Early operational estimation of OLR employed a simple parameterization using the \nwindow channel brightness temperature of the advanced very high resolution radiometer \n(AVHRR) on NOAA 6–7 (Ellingson and Ferraro, 1983; Gruber and Krueger, 1984). New \nalgorithms were developed in subsequent years to improve the accuracy of the OLR.  \nEllingson et al. (1989) have shown that the linear combination of only four (6.6– 6.9 µm; \n7.9–8.5 µm; 13.1–13.6 µm; 14.3–14.7 µm) High Resolution Infrared Sounder (HIRS) \nchannels could account for more than 99% of the OLR total variance. Comparison with the \nERBE (Ellingson et al., 1994) instrument flown in NOAA 9–11 satellites suggested that \nestimates made with HIRS data exhibited errors of the same order as the estimated accuracy \nof ERBE (5 Wm-2), where as use of AVHRR data exhibits monthly bias of -1 to +2 Wm-2 \nand rms differences of about 14 Wm-2 (Gruber et al., 1994). \nOutgoing longwave radiation \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n32\nGeostationary satellite observations have also been used for OLR estimation.  Schmetz and \nLiu (1988) and Cheruy et al. (1991) developed OLR retrieval technique using two channels \n(infrared window and water vapor) of Meteosat. Minnis et al. (1991) developed an algorithm \nto estimate OLR using Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) imager \nwindow channels with additional water vapor information from analysis. Ba and Ellingson \n(2001) estimated OLR using several channels of the GOES sounder and presented \ncomparisons with the CERES measurements. Ba et al. (2003) adapted the HIRS technique to \nGOES sounder and validated the derived OLR with collocated OLR measured from CERES \nonboard Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) and Terra satellites.  Their results \nshow instantaneous agreement within about 7 Wm-2. Singh et al. (2007) estimated OLR using \nthe infrared window and water vapor channels radiances from Kalpana.  \n \nObjective \nTo develop the algorithm for estimating OLR from narrow band radiances from  WV (6.5 – \n7.1 µm), TIR-1 (10.3 – 11.3 µm) and TIR-2 (11.5 – 12.5 µm) channels of INSAT-3D imager. \nAlgorithm is developed using two basic approaches: \ni. \nFirst approach (ALG-1) uses RTM simulated INSAT-3D  radiances and OLR   \nii. \nSecond approach (ALG-2) uses simultaneously measured CERES OLR and  INSAT-\n3D  radiances   \n3.3 \nInputs \n3.3.1     Image and pre-processing data (Dynamic)  \n \nParameter \nResolution \nQuantization \nAccuracy \nSource \nGray count values of \nWV channel  \nPixel \n10 bit \n \nDP (data processing) \nGray count values of \nTIR-1 channel  \nPixel \n10 bit \n- \nDP \nGray count values of \nTIR-2 channel  \nPixel \n10 bit \n- \nDP \nCoefficients for \nconversion of Gray \nvalue to radiances \n- \n- \n- \nDP \nGeolocation file \nPixel \n- \n1 pixel \nDP \n \n3.3.2     Other Auxiliary data and Model Input \nTo develop the empirical relationship between narrow band radiances and OLR using \nradiative transfer approach (ALG-1), a large database of the atmospheric profiles of \ntemperature (T), pressure, water vapor (q), and ozone (O3) concentrations are required.

Since narrow field-of-view (NFOV) radiometers \non-board satellites, such as CERES, measure the upwelling radiance only in specific \noutgoing directions from a scene on Earth at any given time, OLR cannot be measured \ninstantaneously. Given a radiance field, L(θ, Φ) , at the TOA, where θ  is the satellite viewing \nzenith angle, and Φ the azimuth angle, the OLR leaving the earth-atmosphere system, is \nobtained by integrating the radiance field over the solid angle ω of the upper hemisphere: \n2\n2\n0\n0\nOLR\nL( , ) cos sin\nd d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n \n(1) \n \n100 m\n4 m\nL( , )\nL ( , )d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n (2) \nFor an isotropic radiance field, the radiance to OLR conversion is simple (OLR=πL). \nUnfortunately, the radiance field L(θ, Φ) is not isotropic and an accurate portraying  of the \nanisotropy is needed to estimate the OLR from the radiance measurement. The anisotropic \nemission factor (AEF) R(θ, Φ ) is defined as the ratio of the equivalent Lambertian  OLR  to \nthe actual OLR (Loeb et al., 2003). \nL( , )\nR( , )\nOLR\n\n\n\n   \n \n \n \n(3) \nEq.

However, if the observations at entire (e.g \n4 µm – 100 µm) spectral range are not available, a mapping function of the following form \nshould be determined to retrieve OLR from the available, narrow band radiances: \nOutgoing longwave radiation \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n34\ni\nOLR\nF(\nN ( ))\n\n\n\n,\n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n(4) \nWhere  satellite zenith angle and Ni is the observed narrow band radiances in ith channel. \nThe radiance in a particular channel is related to the specific intensity I at wavelength λ and \nthe instrument responsively η as \ni\ni\ni\nN ( )\nI( , )\n( )d\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n \n          \n(5) \n3.4.1.1 \nRadiative Transfer Model \n \nSanta Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model developed by \nRicchiazzi et al (1998) at University of California is used for INSAT-3D imager radiance \nsimulations. SBDART is designed for the analysis of a wide variety of radiative transfer \nproblems encountered in satellite remote sensing and atmospheric energy budget studies. \nSBDART is based on a collection of highly developed and reliable physical models \ndeveloped by the atmospheric science community. A brief description to the key components \nof the model is discussed below:  \nCloud Model: Clouds are a major modulator of the earth’s climate by reflecting visible \nradiation and intercepting part of the infrared radiation emitted by the Earth and re-radiating \nit back to the surface. The computation of radiative transfer within a cloudy atmosphere \nrequires knowledge of the scattering efficiency, the single scattering albedo, and the \nasymmetry factor, which indicates the strength of forward scattering. SBDART contains an \ninternal database of these parameters for clouds computed with a Mie scattering code and \ncovers a range of particle size effective radius in the range 2 to 128 µm. By default, the \nangular distribution of scattered photons is based on the simple Henyey-Greenstein \nparameterization, but more detailed scattering functions may be input as desired.  \nGas Absorption Model: Standard SBDART uses low-resolution band models developed for \nthe LOWTRAN 7 atmospheric transmission code (Pierluissi and Marogoudakis, 1986). \nThese models provide the clear sky atmospheric transmission from 0 to 50000 cm-1 and \ninclude the effects of all radiatively active molecular species found in the earth's atmosphere. \nThe models were derived from detailed line-by-line calculations, which were degraded to 20 \ncm-1 resolution for use in LOWTRAN. This translates to a wavelength resolution of about \n0.005 µm in the visible and about 0.2 µm in the thermal infrared. A capability to read high-\nresolution k-distribution optical depths from a disk file is introduced in SBDART version 2.0 \nwhich is less convenient to use than the standard approach. However, it has the advantage of \nremoving limitations in the ultimate spectral resolution available with SBDART.  \nExtraterrestrial Source Spectra: SBDART has options for three extraterrestrial solar \nspectrum models: LOWTRAN-7 solar spectrum (Shettle and Fenn, 1975), solar models used \nin 5s or MODTRAN-3 solar spectrum.  \nStandard Atmospheric Models: SBDART has six standard atmospheric profiles from the \n5s atmospheric radiation code to model the following typical climatic conditions: tropical, \nmid-latitude summer, mid-latitude winter, subarctic summer, subarctic winter and US62. \nThese model atmospheres (McClatchey et al, 1971) have been widely used in the \natmospheric research community and provide standard vertical profiles of pressure, \ntemperature, water vapor and ozone density. Optionally users can specify their own model \nOutgoing longwave radiation \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n35\natmosphere, e.g, a radiosonde profile. The concentration of trace gases such as CO2 or CH4 \nare assumed to make up a fixed fraction (which may be specified by the user) of the total \nparticle density.  \nStandard Aerosol Models: SBDART can compute the radiative effects of several common \nboundary layer and upper atmosphere aerosol types. In the boundary layer, the user can select \nfrom rural, urban, or maritime aerosols. The total vertical optical depth of boundary layer \naerosols is derived from user specified horizontal meteorological visibility at 0.55 µm and an \ninternal vertical distribution model. In the upper atmosphere up to 5 aerosol layers can be \nspecified, with radiative characteristics that model fresh and aged volcanic, meteoric and the \nclimatological tropospheric background aerosols. The aerosol models included in SBDART \nwere derived from those provided in the 5s and LOWTRAN7.  \nRadiative Transfer Equation Solver: The radiative transfer equation is numerically \nintegrated with DISORT (DIScreet Ordinate Radiative Transfer, Stamnes et al, 1988). The \ndiscrete ordinate method provides a numerically stable algorithm to solve the equations of \nplane-parallel radiative transfer in a vertically inhomogeneous atmosphere. The intensity of \nboth scattered and thermally emitted radiation can be computed at different heights and \ndirections. SBDART is configured to allow up to 65 atmospheric layers and 40 radiation \nstreams (40 zenith angles and 40 azimuthal modes).  \nSurface Models: The ground surface cover is an important determinant of the overall \nradiation environment. In SBDART six basic surface types -- ocean water, lake water, \nvegetation, snow and sand are used to parameterize the spectral reflectivity of the surface. \nThe spectral reflectivity of a large variety of surface conditions is well approximated by \ncombinations of these basic types. For example, the fractions of vegetation, water and sand \ncan be adjusted to generate a new spectral reflectivity representing new/old growth, or \ndeciduous vs. evergreen forest. Combining a small fraction of the spectral reflectivity of \nwater with that of sand yields an overall spectral dependence close to wet soil.  \n3.4.1.2 \nRTM simulated OLR and  INSAT-3D radiances  \n To develop the empirical relationship between narrow band radiances and OLR a large \ndatabase of spectral radiance fields was built using SBDART model. The radiative transfer \ncomputations were performed at 19400 wavelengths covering the thermal region 4–100 m \nfor 4704 realistic conditions of the Earth–atmosphere system. For each element in the \ndatabase, the main inputs for the radiative transfer computations were:  the atmospheric \nprofiles of temperature, pressure, water vapor, and ozone concentrations. These profiles are \nextracted from the TIGR-3 database, which is a representative set of 2311 profiles selected \namong a larger set of worldwide soundings.  Additional 41 diverse profiles of temperature, \nwater vapor and ozone from ECMWF were also taken. The surface temperature is set close to \nthe temperature at the level close to surface in the profile. The cloud cover is generated \nrandomly. The cloud cover may contain up to three overlapping layers, each characterized by \na random height, optical thickness, phase (water or ice), and drop size distribution. Half of \nthe database (2352 elements) corresponds to cloud-free conditions and the other half \ncorresponds to the same conditions but with the addition of cloud cover. For each element in \nthe database, the OLR and the spectral radiance field L (={0º, 5º, . . . 65º}) are computed. \nFilter response function for the INSAT-3D imager WV and thermal channel (TIR-1 and TIR-\n2) were provided as input to the SBDART. Radiances were simulated for each set of profile \nOutgoing longwave radiation \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n36\nand zenith angle at the top of atmosphere (70 km) from SBDART for WV, TIR-1 and TIR-2 \nchannels.   \n 3.4.1.3   Conversion of Narrow Band Radiances to Broad Band Flux (OLR)  \nALG-1 is developed using RTM simulated OLR and INSAT-3D radiances. While ALG-2 is \ndeveloped using the INSAT-3D radiances and collocated (in space and time) CERES \nmeasured OLR. In practice, development of ALG-2 is possible only after the launch of \nINSAT-3D. However, to develop the preliminary version, we have used Visible Infrared \nSpin Scan Radiometer (VISSR) onboard FY-2D (positioned at 86.5º E) radiances to generate \nproxy radiances for INSAT-3D. This is due to the fact that INSAT-3D channels (TIR-1, TIR-\n2 and WV), which will be used for the development of OLR algorithm, are very similar to \nthose of FY-2D channels. INSAT-3D radiances are generated using VISSR measured \nradiances by accounting the difference in the radiances due to the SRF differences of FY-2D \nand INSAT-3D channels. We have also developed the algorithm to estimate the OLR using \nFY-2D measured radiances.   \nThe FY-2D radiance data from 1-15 July and 1-15 December, 2011 over the FY-2D \nfull disk domain were collocated with CERES SSF data from all four instruments (FM1, \nFM2, FM3 and FM4) onboard Terra and Aqua satellites, respectively. The FY-2D radiance \nobservations were averaged for 4x4 pixels (native resolution is 5 km at the sub-satellite \npoint) to match the CERES resolution (about 20 km nadir). The criterion for the FY-2D and \nCERES collocations is taken as time coincidence within ± 5 minutes and a distance window \nof 5 km radius between the FY-2D and the CERES observations. These collocated \nnarrowband radiances, satellite zenith angle and OLR are then used to find the empirical \nrelationship between the OLR, satellite zenith angle and narrowband radiances (Channels; \nIR1, IR2 and IR3 of FY-2D). Using a radiative transfer simulation, we found empirical \nrelationship between INSAT-3D and FY-2D radiances. The developed empirical relationship \nwas then applied on FY-2D measured radiances to obtain the INSAT-3D radiances. These \nFY-2D measured radiances and the INSAT-3D simulated radiances using FY-2D measured \nradiances and collocated CERES OLR were used to develop the OLR algorithm (under \nsecond approach: ALG-2).   \nIn both approaches (ALG-1 and ALG-2), genetic algorithm (GA) is used to determine \nthe optimum relationship between broadband flux (OLR) and spectral radiances of WV and \nthermal infrared channels. A unique advantage of GA is that complex (often nonlinear) \nrelationships between different variables can be obtained in the form of simple and usable \nequations. In the case of other nonlinear methods like ANN, the task of using the algorithm \noften requires a complete understanding of the neural network, which includes a complex \narray of input layers, hidden layers, the shape of the response function at each layer, and the \nweights connecting these layers. A major difference between other nonlinear techniques (like \nANN) and GA is that the algorithm development under GA is almost completely objective \nand data adaptive.  \nThe development of the OLR retrieval algorithm involves a number of steps. In the \nfirst step, the collocated data of narrowband radiances (both FY-2D and INSAT-3D), satellite \nzenith angle and OLR were divided into two unequal random samples. Sample I is used to \ntrain the GA and Sample II is used for evaluation of the algorithm. Genetic algorithm (GA) \nwas then applied to find optimal relationship between narrow band radiances and OLR for \nOutgoing longwave radiation \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n37\ntraining data (Sample I). The GA training provides empirical equations (INSAT-3D as well \nas FY-2D) relating OLR to narrowband radiances and satellite zenith angle.  The root mean \nsquare error (rmse) on the training data is about 7 Wm-2.  The developed algorithm was \napplied on the Sample-II data in order to compute the OLR. The computed OLR for Sample-\nII data was compared with observed OLR and the root mean square error (rmse) was \ncomputed. The root mean square error (rmse) is about 9 Wm-2 (about 3 %) for both FY-2D \nand INSAT-3D.   \n3.4.1.4 Genetic algorithm \nModeling natural phenomena has been a standard practice in atmospheric sciences. \nTraditionally, modeling a physical system requires one to derive the relevant equations from \nfirst principles taking into account the physical laws that determine the system under \nconsideration. Alternatively, when such an approach is not feasible due to some reasons, e.g., \nthe perfect physics of the system is not well understood, or the required computing resources \nare not available, empirical laws governing the physical processes can be obtained by model-\nfitting approaches based on the observed variability of the system and its relationship with \nother parameters. Let us assume that there exists a smooth mapping function P(.) that \nexplains the relationship between a predicted variable x and a set of dependent variables \n[a,b,c,d,e,…], so that  \n                    \n \n \n x = P [a,b,c,d,e, ……..]                                         (6) \n                      In various areas of geophysics, it is a standard practice to employ linear or \nnonlinear regression techniques in order to obtain the form of P(.). However, the choice of a \nregression model is quite subjective, and it is difficult to ensure that a particular regression \nmodel provides the best possible explanation to the variance in a data set. This has inspired \nthe researchers to look for more objective data fitting approaches like genetic algorithm \n(GA).  A genetic algorithm is programmed to approximate the equation, in symbolic form, \nthat best describes the relationship between independent and dependent parameters.   The \ngenetic algorithm considers an initial population of potential solutions, which is subjected to \nan evolutionary process, by selecting those equations (individuals) that best fit the data. The \nstrongest strings (made up from a combination of variables, real numbers, and arithmetic \noperators) of choose a mate for reproduction whereas the weaker strings become extinct. The \nnewly generated population is subjected to mutations that change fractions of information. \nThe evolutionary steps are repeated with the new generation. The process ends after a \nnumber of generations a priori determined by the user. The procedural details of genetic \nalgorithm can be found in Szpiro (1997), Alvarez et al., (2000) and Singh et al (2006). A \nbrief description of genetic algorithm is as follows.  \nFirst, for a desired function x (e.g. in Eq.-6), a set of candidate equations for P(.) is \nrandomly generated. An equation is stored in the computer as a set of characters that define \nthe independent variables, a, b,c,d,e.. etc. in Eq. (6), and four elementary arithmetic operators \n(+,-,x, and /). A criterion that measures how well the equation strings perform on a training \nset of the data is its fitness to the data, defined as sum of the squared differences between \ndata and independent parameter derived from the equation string. The strongest individuals \n(equations with best fits) are then selected to exchange parts of the character strings between \nthem (reproduction and crossover) while individuals less fitted to the data are discarded. \nFinally, a small percentage of the equation strings’ most basic elements, single operators and \nOutgoing longwave radiation \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n38\nvariables, are mutated at random. The process is repeated a large number of times to improve \nthe fitness of the evolving population of equations. The fitness strength of the best scoring \nequation is defined as: \nR2 = 1 – [2 /  (xo- <xo> )2]                                     \n                  (7) \n where  2 =  (xc – xo)2, xc is parameter value estimated by the best scoring equation, xo is \nthe corresponding “true” value, <xo> is the mean of the “true” values of x.  Szpiro (1997) has \nshown the robustness of the genetic algorithm to forecast the behavior of one-dimensional \nchaotic dynamical system.  \n                    \n3.4.1.5 Flow Chart \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3.4.2    Operational Implementation \n3.4.2.1  Step 1 : Computation of the narrow band radiances from gray values \n3.4.2.2  Step 2 : Computation of OLR from narrow band radiances  \n3.4.2.3  Step 3 : Merging of OLR with Geolocation files \n3.5 \nOutputs  \nParameter \nUnit \nMin \nMax \nAccuracy \nResolution \nOLR \nWm-2 \n50 \n400  \n3 % \npixel \n \n3.5.1 Format of the output and the domain \n        Lat, Lon, OLR,   \n        Domain: 50 S to 50 N, 35 E to 135 E \nINSAT-3D imager \nWV, TIR-1 and TIR-2 radiances \nCalculate zenith angle \nOLR retrieval \nOLR coefficients \nGeolocation file \nOLR \nOutgoing longwave radiation \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n39\n3.6 \nValidation \n3.6.1 Data required \nThe OLR computed by the developed algorithms will be compared with observed OLR.

Varma \nQPE Baseline Document \n4.2 \nINTRODUCTION \nWeather and climate affects many sectors of the human activity as well as many \naspects of the world's natural ecosystems. The hydrological cycle is one of the important \ncomponents of Weather and climate system. The hydrological cycle describes the exchange \nof water substance between sea, air, soil, rock, plants and animals. The precipitation and \nevaporation processes significantly affect the global hydrological cycle. The quantitative \nassessment of precipitation is needed to improve understanding of the behavior of global \nenergy and circulation patterns as well as the nature of climate variability. The choice of \nmeasured parameter has been influenced by the cost of installation, operation, longevity and \ntemporal as well as spatial coverage of the instruments. The land based techniques of rainfall \nestimation are not sufficient for global rainfall assessment as about 70% of the Earth is \ncovered with water. The space borne measurement and monitoring of rainfall is, therefore, a \ntopic of major interest since they provide global coverage both on land and ocean for an \nextended period of time. A longstanding promise of meteorological satellites is the improved \nidentification and quantification of precipitation at time scales consistent with the nature and \ndevelopment of precipitation processes. Meteorological satellites expand the coverage and \ntime span of conventional ground-based rainfall data for a number of applications. The \nprimary scope of satellite rainfall monitoring is to provide information on rainfall occurrence, \namount and distribution over the regional to continental scales. The uneven distribution of \nrain gauges and weather radars and the relative lack of rainfall measurements over the oceans \nhave significantly limited the use of global as well local data. Precipitation is one of the most \nvariable quantities in space and time. Precipitation also has a direct impact on human life that \nother atmospheric phenomena seldom have: an example is represented by heavy rain events \nand flash floods (Barrett and Michell, 1991). Geostationary weather satellite visible (VIS) \nand infrared (IR) imagers provide the rapid temporal update cycle needed to capture the \ngrowth and decay of precipitating clouds. Microwaves provide the interaction of radiation \nwith hydrometeors but with coarser resolution and limited swath widths of satellites with in \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n45\ntropical orbit such as the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) (Kummerow et al., \n1998) and of sensors in polar orbits like the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) series.  \n4.2.1 Overview  \nOperational applications, require quantitative rainfall determination from a variety of \nprecipitating systems, which differ both dynamically and microphysically. This fact prompts \nfor non-unique solutions based on the physics of precipitation formation processes. Barrett \nand Martin (1981) and Kidder and Vonder Haar (1995) give excellent reviews of the \navailable methods. Petty (1995) has examined the status of satellite rainfall estimation over \nland. Recent reviews Levizzani et al. (2001) has covered results and future perspectives from \nthe geostationary orbit. The perspective varies widely from the relatively simple methods \nused for climatic-scale analyses (e.g. Arkin and Ardanuy, 1989; Arkin and Janowiak, 1991) \nto the more elaborate instantaneous rainrate estimations for research and nowcasting (Ba and \nGruber, 2001; Turk et al., 2000; Vicente et al., 1998). \n  Recent technological developments of MW instruments on board polar orbiters have \nbeen dramatic but the use of VIS, IR and water vapor (WV) channels of geostationary \nsatellites is still indispensable. In particular, the launch of the newest generation of \ngeostationary satellites, the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite GOES-I-M \nseries (Menzel and Purdom,1994) and the upcoming METEOSAT Second Generation \n(MSG) (Schmetz et al., 2002) with its Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager \n(SEVIRI), adds new channels to the traditional VIS/IR/WV triplet. Some of the new channels \nhave been tested for decades as part of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer \n(AVHRR) series on board the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) \npolar orbiters or have other heritages.  \nMultispectral data have long since been available both from polar orbiting and \ngeostationary satellite sensors and used for retrieving cloud properties. The relevant channels \nfor cloud characterization were part of the payload of the polar satellites, while the sensors at \ngeosynchronous altitude were almost exclusively devoted to VIS-IR operational monitoring \nof precipitation system displacements. This has considerably changed in the past few years \nsince more and more sophisticated sensors have been conceived for the GEO orbits that will \nallow for global real-time cloud characterization.  \nCloud radiative properties at VIS, near IR (NIR) and IR wavelengths have long since \nbeen studied and documented (among others Arking and Childs, 1985; Cheng et al., 1993, \nSaunders and Kriebel, 1988; Slingo and Schrecker, 1982). In the thermal IR the radiative \nproperties are sensitive to the size distribution of the hydrometeors. In particular, an increase \nin the particle size increases the transmissivity, decreasing the reflectivity and increasing the \nemissivity of the cloud layer. This latter dominates at these wavelengths. In the NIR (e.g. the \n3.9 mm MSG channel) the emissivity of a cloud layer is lower than in the thermal IR \nwindow: there is a large contribution of reflected radiation at the cloud top. Clouds with \nsmall hydrometeors scatter and reflect much of the 3.9 mm radiance. An increase in cloud \nparticle size or the presence of large drops or ice crystals near the cloud top reduces the 3.9 \nmm reflectance from the cloud. containing more ice reflect less solar radiation in the 3.7 - 3.9 \nmm range as ice strongly absorbs at these wavelengths and ice crystals are generally larger \nthan cloud droplets at cloud top. NIR reflectance mostly refers to cloud particles effective \nradius (re).VIS reflectance is primarily due to cloud optical depth. \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n46\nSeveral methods have been proposed for the retrieval of cloud parameters from \nvarious cloud types. Pioneering studies were conducted by Arking and Childs (1985) and \nNakajima and King (1990). Water Vapor images show the presence of water in the gas form \nbetween 22,000 and 35,000 feet above the earth's surface. The brighter white color indicates \nareas of moisture. Black depicts neutral. Lensky and Rosenfeld (1997) have conceived a \nmultispectral rainfall estimation technique based on the method of Rosenfeld and Gutman \n(1994). They concentrated on areas of around 2000 km2 that Rosenfeld and Gagin (1989) \nshowed to be the critical limit beyond which a further increase in cloud cluster area does not \nresult in higher rain rates.  \nIR and NIR channels other than the thermal IR window show some potential for \napplication to rainfall estimations. Techniques for the instantaneous delineation of convective \nrainfall areas using split window data were initially conceived for the NOAA AVHRR (Inoue, \n1987a,b, 1997) and are instrumental for the detection of semi-transparent cirrus clouds (Inoue, \n1985). These techniques rely upon the detection of non-precipitating cirrus and low-level \ncumulus clouds using the two window channels at 10.5 - 11.5 and 11.5 - 12.5 µm (the so-\ncalled split window). The information content of the split window channels partially corrects \nerroneous rainfall area delineation (and consequent frequent rainfall overestimate) of simple \nIR techniques producing better false alarm ratios (FAR). The NIR 3.9 µm channel of GOES-\n8/9 satellites includes spectral features suitable for applications to rainfall detection and \nestimation. This channel was included for a long time in NOAA/AVHRR instruments \n(centered at 3.7 µm) for a variety of purposes including ice discrimination and sun-glint \ndetection. Vicente (1996) developed a simple and fast algorithm for rainfall retrieval using \nthe 11 and 3.9 µm channels with the obvious advantage of nighttime use and sensitivity to \nthe presence of ice and water vapor.  \nIn the present ATBD document the description of the scientific algorithms which will be \ndeveloped and used to estimate rainfall from two of the standard operational algorithms of \nNOAA from the data acquired by the Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR ) onboard \nINSAT-3D satellite. VHRR produces images in six spectral channels, in the Visible (VIS), \nNear Infra-red (NIR), Mid Wave Infra-Red (MWIR),  and Infra-Red (IR) part of the \nspectrum covering the following channels: VIS 0.6μm,  NIR 1.6μm, MWIR 3.9μm, WV \n6.7μm,   IR 10.8μm, IR 12.0μm . Each channel of the Imager has different resolution as \nmentioned in the Table-1 in sections ahead. \n \n4.2.2 Objectives \nThere are two main objectives under the rainfall retrieval algorithms from INSAT-3D.. These \ntechniques are popularly known as GOES Precipitation Index (GPI) and GOES Multispectral \nRainfall Algorithm Technique (GMSRA). Both the algorithms are state of art and aimed at \nestimation of rainfall with different applications at different spatial and temporal \nrequirements respectively. First GPI related objectives are the implementation of the \nalgorithm following Arkin (1979), while the second one is related to the development of the \nalgorithm named GMSRA following Ba and Gruber (2001). Originally the GPI technique has \nbeen in operation for a large scale rainfall estimation by Global community for more than \ntwo decades. The GMSRA on the other hand is a new one and is developed and used only by \nUSA based on integrated efforts from many group of researchers along with the supporting \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n47\ninfrastructure (like ground truths with high spatial and temporal coverage’s etc.).  from a \nhundred of radars on the ground. \nThe inherent limitations of optical channels remains persistent for rainfall retrieval as \nthe rainfall in the ground is inferred by cloud top signatures only. There is no direct physical \nconnection between the rain/cloud and ice hydrometeors within the clouds with radiance \nemanating from cloud tops to the sensor. The accuracy of rainfall estimate is improves only \nmarginally even with significant new efforts. However, the high spatial and temporal \ncoverage of Geostationary optical measurements is the very strong point along with the \nresolution capabilities of the sensors. At the same time microwaves have a direct physical \nconnections with vertical structure of rainfall and thus with the cloud, rain and ice \nhydrometeors. But the non-portability of microwave sensors to the geostationary platforms \ntill date due to technological constraints is a limitation and thus only low earth orbiting \nsatellites can provide the rainfall information of land, ocean and atmosphere as on now. With \nthe advent of active and passive radar and radiometric sensors onboard a single satellite (e.g. \nTropical Rainfall Measuring Mission-TRMM) we envisage that a technique like GMSRA \ncan be further improved for Indian tropical regions and more reliable rainfall information can \nbe retrieved. We henceforth call this technique as INSAT Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm \n(IMSRA), as a specific technique for Indian Tropical regions. Our objectives for both the \ntechniques (GPI and IMSRA) here are based on these premises and are outlined below \n(mainly in cases of IMSRA). \nA1. INSAT-3D Rainfall using  GPI Method: \n1.  To generate  a total day rainfall maps using 3 hourly brightness temperatures of IR (11 \num) images for 1.0 x 1.0 deg  latitude /longitude boxes in an area -500 to +500 lat and 300E to \n1300E using Arkin’s GPI method. \n2. To generate mean spatial variance and histogram of 24 classes of temperatures at 1.0 x 1.0 \ndeg  latitude/longitude. \n 3.

Estimation of rainfall on pentad, monthly mean, seasonal mean and annual mean scales \nafter due calibration/validation from radar and inter-satellite comparisons as above, rainfall. \nA2. To Develop Precipitation Estimates Using the Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm \n(IMSRA) Technique: \nThe relation between precipitation amount and cloud fraction as seen from satellite passive \nradiometers in case of GPI technique above, though simple and straightforward it might seem, \nhas not yet reached completely satisfactory accuracy, effectiveness, and time/space coverage. \nThere are numerous applications in meteorology and hydrology where accurate information \nat scales smaller than the existing  1.0  products (e.g. daily or sub daily estimates at \nresolutions of 1  and down to the 0.25 0) would be invaluable. There is also increasing \ndemand from the meteorology and climate community for such products over extended \nperiods. High-resolution rainfall information is available for limited areas using \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n48\ncombinations of ground-based radar and dense networks of rain gauges. In India in particular, \nwhere the need of high spatial and temporal rainfall is essential, for large and varied areas of \nIndia (Western Ghats, plateaus, Himalayan Regions, North-Eastern Regions, Arid and Semi-\nArid Zones) however, the in-situ infrastructure necessary for this form of precipitation \nmonitoring network is not in place.  Recent developments mostly refer to microwave (MW) \nsensors on board polar orbiters, but the use of visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) sensors of \ngeostationary satellites for a variety of applications is by no means over. Thus a suit of both \nsupplementing each others would be the ideal situation, particularly when the highly \nadvanced microwave sensors data from various international satellites are available on near \nreal time basis.   \nThe main objectives here in IMSRA algorithm are to estimate rainfall by developing \na Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm which is an optimal combination of GMSRA and some of \nthe innovative proposed approaches that utilizes microwave remote sensing measurements \nfrom polar orbiting satellites. Here, the rainfall algorithm is with more advantageous that \ncombines satellite passive microwave and infrared (IR) data to account for limitations in both \ndata types. Rainfall estimates are produced at the high spatial resolution and temporal \nfrequency of the IR data using rainfall information from the PMW data. Over the last few \nyears, a number of groups world wide have embarked on development of such techniques \nwherein the advantages of geosynchronous viz.  vast  coverage   and  near  sufficient  space-\ntime  sampling,  and  polar  passive  microwave radiometers  viz.  more  physically  based \nretrievals,  are  synergistically  used  to generate    tropical  rainfall  on  various  scales (e.g. \nAdler et al. 1994, Todd et al. 2001, Gairola and Krishnamurti 1992). With above background \nthe objectives for Multi Spectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA) are as follows. \nThe technique has the  following components: \n1. Identify  areas for very deep convective cores from IR and WV channels ( 11m-\n6.7m), which corresponds  well with rainfall. \n2. To screen mid-to upper level clouds with or without thin cirrus above the rain and \nnon-rain baring clouds. \n3. Cloud growth classification based  on temporal gradients  of TIR – TB’s. \n4. Filtering of low and non raining clouds along with the warm and semi-transperent \nclouds based on IR and WV  when rainfall is estimated for clouds having brightness \ntemperatures colder than 240K. \n5. Spatial and temporal co-location of INSAT-TIR brightness temperature, and TRMM / \nSSM/I rainfall for creation of matched database. \n6. To compute instantaneous rain rate using pre-calibrated rain rate for cloud top \nbrightness temperature ( 11 m) for each pixel classified as containing raining clouds \nalong with Satellite Microwave Radiometric measurements (e.g TRMM Microwave \nImager-TMI). \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n49\n7. To adjust the rainfall estimates in association with the product of Integrated \nPrecipitable water and Relative Humidity from 500 mb – Surface (from Eta/IMD \nmodel). \n8. Validation of rainfall  with Doppler Weather Radar data and fine tunning of  \nalgorithm. \n9. Finally to estimate rainfall would be estimated in different spatial and temporal grid \nscales based on all the above components of the IMSRA algorithm. \n4.3 \nInputs \n4.3.1 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) \n \nThe details for the required satellite data for both GPI and IMSRA are provided in following \ntable: \nParameter \nResolution Quantization Accuracy \nSource \nRadiometric and \ngeometric corrected \ngray count values of \nTIR-1 channel (10.5) \npixel \n10 bit \n-- \nDerived from raw data \nby DP (data \nprocessing) \nRadiometric and \ngeometric corrected \ngray count values of \nTIR-2 channel (11.5) \npixel \n10 bit \n- \nDerived from raw data \nby DP \nRadiometric and \ngeometric corrected \ngray count values of \nVIS channel \npixel \n10 bit \n- \nDerived from raw data \nby DP \nRadiometric and \ngeometric corrected \ngray count values of , \nWV channel (6.7) \npixel \n10 bit \n- \nDerived from raw data \nby DP \nRadiometric and \ngeometric corrected \ngray count values of 3.9 \nmm \npixel \n10 bit \n- \nDerived from raw data \nby DP \nGray value to \nbrightness temperature \nconversion table \n- \n- \n0.3 K \nDerived by DP \nGeolocation file \nPixel \n- \n1 pixel \nDerived by DP using \nCalibration Table \n4.3.2 Other Auxiliary data and Model Inputs \nIn addition to satellite data from INSAT-3D, radar and rain gauge data, and atmospheric \nmoisture products (integrated precipitable water and relative humidity from 500-mb surface) \nobtained from the IMD/Eta Model analysis are essential on required grid spacing in different \ntemporal scales. The gridded rainfall data from Doppler Weather Radars are needed from \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n50\nIMD at every one hourly time interval on 1x1 and 0.25x0.25 deg grid resolution for GPI and \nIMSRA techniques. The rainfall from DWRs should be well calibrated and  the products \nshould be well converted to rain rate using an appropriate Z-R relation well tested and \nvalidated over Indian regional sites of the respective radar locations. In some cases one \nhourly rainfall from fast response rain gauges would be highly desirable particularly the areas \nwhere the DWR coverage is not at all there. Thus 1 to 3 hourly gauge-adjusted DWR rain \nrates, and hourly and daily gauge rainfall obtained from the IMD stations are important. The \nEta / IMD model forcast/analysed fields of total precipitable water (TPW) and relative \nhumidity fields should be available from IMD at every 3 hourly within 0.5x0.5 respectively. \n \n \n4.4 \nAlgorithm Functional Specifications \n4.4.1 Overview: \nNOAA/NESDIS emphasizes use of meteorological satellites for the study of flash floods. \nHeavy precipitation and flash floods are often a multi scale and concatenating event from the \nglobal scale to the synoptic scale, to the mesoscale and finally to the storm scale.  Satellite-\nderived algorithms, conceptual models, and interpretation techniques are used to provide \ninformation on these various scales to monitor, assess, and predict heavy precipitation and \nflash floods. In the satellite data, global scale connections between the tropics and middle \nlatitudes are observed.   These connections are movements, surges, or plumes of water vapor \nthat are often associated with unstable air and prepare the environment for heavy \nprecipitation and flash floods. On the synoptic scale, the 6.7 m water vapor is especially \nParameter \nResolution \nAccuracy \nSource \nTotal Water Vapour \n \n \nRelative Humidity \n \n \n \n \nDoppler Weather Radar - \nSurface Rain \n \nSurface Rain Gauge on \nhourly basis (from Fast \nResponse Rain Gauges, \nAWS ) and Total Day \nbasis \n0.5 X 0.5 deg \n \n \n0.5 X 0.5 deg \n \n \n \n \n0.25 X 0.25 deg \n \n        - \n \n        - \n      \n        - \n Eta \nModel \nAnalysis \n(IMD) \n(500 \nmb \nto \nsurface) \nEta \nModel \nAnalysis \n(IMD) \n(500 \nmb \nto \nsurface) \n \n \nDWR \nobservations \nat \nIMD Sites (Every 1-3 \nHour, \nin \n0.250x0.250 \ngrids \n \n \n------ Do ------ \n \nTRMM / SSM/I Rainfall \n1. \nScan-mode \nOrbital data  \n2. \nGrid \nmode \n0.250 X 0.250 data \n \n      -  \nFrom Internet Site \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n51\nuseful for detecting jet streaks, vorticity centers and other features that are associated with \nupward vertical motion and lift the moist, unstable air resulting in the production of clouds \nand precipitation.  Whether or not heavy precipitation and flash floods will occur are \ngenerally determined on the mesoscale to storm scale.  On the mesoscale, infrared (10.7 m \nand 3.9 m), visible, and water vapor (6.7 m) are used to locate boundaries (both frontal \nand thunderstorm-produced) and short waves that may initiate, focus, and maintain the heavy \nprecipitation.  Terrain features such as orographic uplift have the same effect of anchoring, \nintensifying,  and prolonging the precipitation.   On the storm scale, the intensity, movement, \nand propagation of the precipitation system (e.g., thunderstorms) is used to determine how \nmuch, when, and where the heavy precipitation is going to move during the next zero to three \nhours (called Nowcasting).  High resolution infrared (10.7 m) and visible are the principal \ndata sets used in this diagnosis.   \nLarge scale precipitation values are of importance in many fields and anomalies in large scale \nprecipitation are also known to have a close relationship with global circulation anomalies. \nSatellite based rain estimation techniques can be classified into two broad categories, viz, (1) \nestimation of precipitation on near real time, e.g. Scofield and Oliver (1977), etc. and (2) \nestimation of average precipitation over a large area for a period of time ranging from a day \nto a month e.g., Richards and Arkin (1981) etc. In any of these two the estimation criteria is \nbased on some statistical relationship. \nIn case of GOES, data from five channels are used: the visible channel (0.65 mm), used when \navailable to select optically thick clouds; channel 2 (3.9 mm), used to retrieve reff of \nhydrometeors during daytime; the water vapor channel (6.7 mm); and thermal channels 4 (11 \nmm) and 5 (12 mm). The 11 mm channel is used to determine cloud-top brightness \ntemperature, and the 12-mm channel is used in conjunction with the 11-mm channel to \nestimate cloud-top temperature. The estimated cloudtop temperature is utilized to compute \nthe thermal emission at 3.9 mm, which is then subtracted from measurements of that channel \nto yield the reflected solar radiation in the 3.9-mm spectral band. \nIn the statistical relationship between IR cloud pixel brightness temperature from satellite \nsensor and surface rainfall measurements  the mean rainfall rate R varies as a function of \nbrightness temperature (BT). But  the uncertainty in rainfall rate is quite large and also varies \nwith BT.  The GPI method uses a simple two-piece threshold function approximation of this \nrelationship  Although crude, the GPI method works quite well for the estimation of monthly \nrainfall over large areas, partly because the over- and underestimation of spatial and temporal \nerrors cancel each other in the aggregation procedure.  \nComplete software package for derivation of QPE using Kalpana-1, INSAT-3A,  INSAT-3D \nVHRR data from two important algorithms like GPI, and IMSRA has been asked for. Both of \nthem are the operational at NOAA/NESDIS and has been developed after years of research \nand development efforts by various investigators. The theoretical background for GPI and \nGMSRA respectively are given below: \n4.4.1.1. Theoretical Background for GPI Algorithm:  \n4.4.1.1.1 Physical explanation of rainfall with infrared (IR) images \nThe satellite IR images are composed of measured radiant energy originating in the \natmosphere or from the land and water surface below. The intensity of this energy integrated \nover all wavelength, by Stefan-Boltzmann law, is proportional to fourth power of \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n52\ntemperature. The Stefan-Boltzmann law is valid for a perfect black body. If the medium \nemits spectral radiant energy according to some temperature less than its thermal temperature, \nthan a second factor called emissivity is introduced. The emissivity of a body determine its \nemission efficiency. Thus, we can define brightness temperature of a body Tb, which is \nrelated to its physical  temperature  T by following equation:   \nTb =  T \nwhere,  is emissivity of the object. If.  = 1, Tb = T, its a black body; if  = 0, Tb = 0, its a \nwhite body; if 0 <  < 1, Tb < T,  and its a gray body.  \nThe IR, for rainfall estimation, refers to thermal IR band that is 10.0 - 12.5 m. This is a \natmospheric window, and all earthly objects radiate maximum spectral power in this band. In \nthis band the absorption is strong for clouds and land/water surfaces and slight for gaseous \nconstituents of the atmosphere. For surfaces, which are opaque and do not transmit radiation, \nmeasured intensity is closely approximated by the fourth power of the temperature. For those \nsurfaces, which are not   opaque - such as some clouds - measured intensity is approximated \nby effective emissivity times fourth power of the temperature. This effective emissivity will \nbe referred more often as cloud emissivity here after. The cloud emissivity   cannot be \nmeasured from observations at a single wavelength interval. Often it is simply assumed to be \nunity. Then the temperature calculated from observed intensity of radiation is called \n`brightness temperature’. Only when  = 1, brightness temperature equals to black body \ntemperature. \nThe value of IR measurements to rainfall estimate lies in the nearly universal condition of \nlapse of temperature with height through the troposphere. If the temperature is known with \nheight, either from actual sounding or from climatology, the height of the cloud can be \ninfrared from the satellite IR observations. Ordinarily, gray clouds are not useful in this \ncontext, because  < 1 implies clouds which are thin (and therefore without precipitation). \nThe more serious problem is distinguishing between cold clouds that are radiometerelly thick \nbut are confined to the upper and middle troposphere, and cold clouds which extend into \nlower troposphere.  \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n53\n \n4.4.1.1.2 Flow Chart for QPE from GPI: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.4.1.1.3 Operational Implementation \nStep 1 : Conversion from gray count to BT \nThe INSAT-3D infrared thermal images of 0000, 03000, 0600, …., 2100 UTC, i.e., \nevery three hours, are to be used. Infrared pixel has dimensions of 8 x 8 km in case of \nKALPANA and INSAT-3A and 4x4 km in case of INSAT-3D, so that several pixels \nfall within 1.00x1.00 box. The grey shade value (0-1023) of each pixel in a given \nimage is read and the corresponding brightness temperature is to be calculated from a \nlook-up table. Pixel lying outside the chosen area of analysis are to be ignored while \nwithin it are assigned to appropriate box.  \nStep 2: Histogram Generation: \nAfter the temperatures of all the pixels in a box are known they are to be distributed \nto generate 3 hourly 24 class histogram of brightness temperatures of IR (11 um) \nINSAT IR Data \n3 Hourly Image \nConversion from Grey \nCount to TBs \nLook Up Table for \nCalibration \nDetection of Deep \nConvective Clouds \nFractional Rain \nCloud Coverage \nEstimation of Rainfall \n \nGeneration of 24 \nClasses Histogram, \nmean & variance \nEstimation of daily \nRainfall (8 images) \nEstimation of Monthly  \nRainfall \nEstimation of Seasonal \nRainfall \nRainfall Validation \n(DWR/SFRG) \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n54\nimages for 1.0 x 1.0 deg  latitude /longitude boxes in an area -50 to + 50 deg.  lat and \n30 to 130 deg longitude from the sub-satellite point.  \nStep 3: Grid-wise Statistics  \nGenerate 3 hourly mean and spatial variance of temperatures at 1.0 x 1.0 deg  \nlatitude/longitude within the area 40 deg lat/long from the sub-satellite point. \nStep 4: Grid-wise Rain Clod Detection: \nThe fractional cloud coverage within a grid box is the ratio of the pixels of cooler \nthan specified threshold temperature to the total number of pixels. This gives the \nmeasure of the fractional area of the box covered by clouds with tops colder than \nthreshold. Finally the estimates of precipitation using the GPI technique in the grid \nspacing of 1.0 x 1.0 lat/lon will be carried out.  This work indicated a high \ncorrelation between the fractional coverage of \"cold\" clouds and observed rainfall. It \nwas determined that the highest correlation between the parameters was produced \nusing a 1.0 degree latitude/longitude spatial scale. An estimation method using linear \nregression was developed. The regression procedure yielded the simple estimation \nequation:  \nR = [3 mm h-1] X [frac] X [hours]  \nwhere R is the rainfall estimate in millimeters; frac is the fractional coverage of \ncloud-top temperature < 235K for the desired 1.0 degree latitude/longitude region; \nand hours indicate the number of hours in the observation period.  \nStep: 5 Sub-Grid Scale Rainfall:    \nIn order to produce precipitation estimates at finer temporal and spatial resolutions, it \nis necessary to develop an improved method.  Sub –grid scale is possible with help of \nrecent developments at NOAA/NESDIS. However, the GPI algorithm will also be \nattempted to provide at 0.5 degree latitude/longitude grids by some alternative \napproach. Based on this algorithm QPE on  daily, pentad, moving average, monthly \nmean, seasonal mean and annual mean will be produced. \nStep: 6 Validations: \nRegarding the validation of the derived QPE the DWR (at present four at Chennai, \nSHAR, Kolkatta, Machliputtnam and some more are planned by IMD)  and Surface \nRain Gauges (SFRG) Data at different spatial and temporal scales will be highly \ndesirable in and around the maximum validation sites in temporal window of every \nhour.  \nRemarks: \nDuring the days when all the 8 images per day are not available, rain rate will be provided \nwith a flag. Provisions of average rainfall estimation will be made for all the cases when  \nmore than 50% of data is available. Similar approach will be followed with the Pentad or \nMonthly scale average rainfall estimates.  \n \n \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n55\n4.4.1.2  IMSRA technique:  \n4.4.1.2.1 Theoretical Background: \nThe developmental work related to the INSAT Multi-Spectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA) \nproposed here as an inhouse R & D effort, originally follows the GMSRA approach along \nwith innovative alternative  features (i.e. the satellite microwave  radiometric measurements) \nfor the estimation  of precipitation.   The theoretical basis is that \n1. Bright clouds in the VIS and clouds with cold tops in the IR imagery that are \nexpanding (in early and mature stages of development) produce more rainfall. \n2. Clouds with cold tops that are becoming warmer produce little or no rainfall. \n3. Merging of cumulonimbus (Cb) clouds increases the rainfall rate of the merging \nclouds. \n4. Most of the significant rainfall occurs in the upwind (at anvil level) portion of a \nconvective system. \n5. Cloud micro-physics plays an important role in understanding the precipitation and \nthus effective radius of cloud top temperatures are to be known (say 3.9 mm during \nday time). \n6. The   humidity and total precipitable water as a background field characterizes the \nrainfall process identification.  \n7. For each pixel classified as containing raining clouds based on above criterions, the \nassociated instantaneous rain rate can be computed using pre-calibrated mean rain \nrate for cloud top brightness temperature using Satellite  Passive Microwave \nRadiometer (e.g. TRMM-TMI) and/or Active Microwave Radar (TRMM-PR). \n8. Finally the retrieved rainfall from earlier step and  Doppler Weather Radar data on \navailable locations in India would be used both for calibration and validation of the \nalgorithm. \n9. Production of rainfall maps on every 3 hourly and daily basis on 0.50 x0.50 and above \ngrid spacing. \n \nSeveral such features are integrated in finalizing the estimation of rainfall using \nmeasurements from mult-spectral channels (Vis, IR, WV and microwave etc.). Physical \nexplanation of rainfall with infrared (IR) images have been discussed previously which is \ncommon for GPI algorithm. In addition the Physical explanation of rainfall with visible (vis) \nimages is being presented here in brief. Various researches so far have pointed that that with \nthicker clouds the probability of rainfall and rain intensity is increased. This relationship is \nstrongest for clouds warmer than -15° C. It is also noted that marine clouds produce heavier \nrainfall. The possible explanation for this lies in the process of cloud growth and droplet \ngrowth rates. In clouds warmer than -15° C, precipitation results from coalescence. The large \ncloud thickness allows more time for growth before droplets fall out of the cloud. However, \nthe other factors like droplet concentration, evaporation and cloud temperature are also \nimportant. Difference in precipitation probability between marine and continental clouds \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n56\nwere attributed to difference in concentration of condensation nuclei and of droplets, and \ndifference in evaporation below the cloud base.  \nSatellite passive microwave and more recently, active microwave rain radar are able \nto provide accurate estimation of rain rates. However they are known to have  but poor \ntemporal sampling. Again the estimates from polar orbiting satellites are subject to the bias  \nin regions where diurnal  cycle of rainfall is pronounced. Still the instantaneous \nmeasurements of rainfall from microwave sensors are more accurate and thus are useful in \ncalibrating other sensors like visible and IR.   At present, the algorithms for the quantitative \nestimation of rainfall from microwave observations are quite successful but suffer from a \nscarcity of sufficient verification data over the oceans. Theoretical and empirical studies \naddressing the problem of rain  retrieval and their critical assessment continues to appear.  A \ndefinitive algorithm is contnuously in developing stage because of the complex and variable \nmicrophysical and mesoscale  structure of precipitation vis-à-vis coarser resolution of \nmicrowave sensors.  As a source of microwave measurements, we use the rainfall data from \nthe SSM/I Defense Meteorological Satellite Program  (DMSP). Several algorithms have been \ndeveloped for various SSM/I sensors of the DMSP series. The SSM/I rainfall used here is \nbased on Ferraro and Marks (1995). The SSM/I had a conical scan with a swath width of \nabout 1400 km and TRMM has swath width of about 800 km and the rainfall is retrieved by \nNASA-GPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm. Use of microwave data with those of VI/IR is \nmost plausible choice to mitigate the problem of resolution in microwaves and augmentation \nof rain estimates from IR measurements.  \nFollowing the main features of Ba and Gruber (2001),  from GMSRA, that combines mul-\ntispectral measurements of the satellites to estimate rainfall along with the present algorithm, \nIMSRA is thus proposed  in combination with additional satellite microwave measurements. \nThus the principal innovations of IMSRA relative to previous infrared/visible algorithms \nalone is that it combines several cloud properties used in a variety of techniques in a single \nand comprehensive rainfall algorithm. For example, the technique uses cloud-top \ntemperatures as a basis of rain estimation (e.g., Arkin and Meisner 1987; Ba et al. 1995; \nVicente et al. 1998), and it utilizes the effective radii of cloud particles (e.g., Rosenfeld and \nGutman 1994) and spatial and temporal temperature gradients (e.g., Adler and Negri 1988; \nVicente et al. 1998) to screen out nonraining clouds. The algorithm have the following steps \nwhich are heavily drawn from (Ba, M., and A. Gruber, 2001). \n \nStep 1. Screening Method: \nOne of the most important aspects in estimating rainfall using IR measurements is to \ndistinguish nonprecipitating cirrus from active cold convective clouds. To remove cirrus \nclouds, an empirical procedure developed by Adler and Negri (1988) was adapted in \nNOAA/NESDIS for areas smaller than originally applied. A slope (S) and a temperature \ngradient (G,) are computed for each local temperature minimum in a window of 25 GOES \npixels [note that Adler and Negri (1988) searched an entire cloud area for points colder than \ntheir neighbors]. The terms G, and S are given by Eq. (I) and Eq. (2), respectively: \nGt = Tavg -Tmin  \nand  \n \n \n(1) \nS = 0.568 (Tmin -217)  \n \n \n(2) \nwhere T min is the local minimum in the window of 25 X 25 pixels, and as in Adler and \nNegri (1988), Tavg is the mean temperature of the 6 pixels surrounding the current pixel (4 \npixels along the scan and 2 pixels across the scan because the pixel offset along the scan is \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n57\napproximately one-half as large as across the scan). Based on G and S the decision is made \nabout the cirrus delineation. \nThere are many channels needed for this screening procedure  and has been originally \ndeveloped only for mid latitudes, we are aware of a more recent cloud classification approach \nby CNES as an alternative (Roca et al. 2002). This method is based on classification of clear \nsky, low clouds, warm semitransparent clouds, mid-to-upper level clouds or without thin \ncirrus above, mid-to-upper level clouds, and finally deep convection with or without thin \ncirrus above.  \n \nStep 2: Micro-physical properties of clouds:  \n \nDuring the day time when the visible channel is available and the radiance at 3.9 mm is \ndominated by the solar reflected part, the effective radius of cloud particles at the cloud tops \ncan be computed for overcast pixels. As stated by Ba and Gruber (2001), the first step in \nderiving the effective particle radius consists of selecting only pixels filled with optically \nthick clouds because measurements obtained from thin clouds include radiances both emitted \nand reflected by clouds. For optically thick clouds defined as having a visible reflectance \ngreater than 0.40, the transmissivity at 3.9mm wavelength can be neglected. So with the \nassumption that the cloud is a Lambertian surface, the emissivity can be expressed by 1 - A, \nwhere A is the spectral albedo at 3.9 mm. Thus, the observed radiance L at 3.9 mm is then \ngiven by \n  \nL = AS0/π + (1-A) PEBB \n \n \n(3) \nwhere So is the solar irradiance in the GOES 3.9-J.l0l band and PEBB is the equivalent \nblackbody emitted thermal radiation at 3.9 mm for cloud-top temperature T,. Thus, the albedo \nA is obtained from Eq. (4): \n \n \n \nA = L – PEBB /(S0/ π - PEBB)  \n(4) \nThe effective radius of cloud particles is defined as \n \n \n \n \n \nwhere N(r) is the number concentration of particles having radius r. The effective radius, \nwhich is dependent on the spectral albedo A at 3.9 µm, is retrieved using the results obtained \nby Rosenfeld and Gutman (1994), which were tabulated in a lookup table of A versus reff \nusing an inversion of a radiative transfer model (Nakajima and King 1990). This is however, \na grey are of research and the studies for microphysical properties of clouds is replaced with \nmore innovative research element of using more physically based microwave observations of \nhydrometeors in synergism with the Geostationary infrared observations.  \n \nStep 3. Pre-calibration of Rain Rate Using Satellite Microwave Data \nAfter the clouds are classified for their rain–no-rain baring properties, the IR radiances are to \nbe calibrated against the near instantaneously collocated microwave rainfall measurements.  \nThe calibration with the contemporary satellites like TRMM and SSMI (whichever is \navailable during IR acquisitions) would be highly desirable.  TRMM is a low inclination \ntropical orbiting, while SSM/I (at present two functional) are the polar orbiting satellites. The \n                  \nReff  =    ( N(r)r3dr ) / (N(r)r2 dr') \n             (5) \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n58\nrainfall estimation from these satellite sensors are based on NASA’s GPROF (Goddard \nProfiling) Algorithm. These are most reliable microwave satellite rainfall estimates for \ncalibrating the thermal IR radiances to estimate rainfall. A large data base of collocated \nINSAT-3D – IR Radiances along with TRMM/SSMI rainfall rates will be generated over \nland and oceanic regions. The retrieval of rainfall thus, would be carried out using this data \nbase using multiple regression approach. The coefficients for land and oceanic regions will \nbe derived separately. Over land regions the further classification would be possible only \nafter extensive validations. The calibration with microwave derived rain will be dynamically \nupdated in case there are changes in the rainfall products itself. \n \nStep 4. Moisture Availability and Sub-cloud Adjustments: \nA moisture correction factor is to be used to adjust for the tendency of the overestimation of \nprecipitation in wet regions and underestimate in dry regions (Vicente et al. 1998). This \ncorrection factor, as first proposed by Scofield (1987) consisted of the precipitable water \n(PW, in inches) and  relative humidity (RH, expressed as a decimal fraction) from the 500 \nhPa to surface layer of the IMD model. The functional form of rainfall and IR brightness \ntemperature relationship would be further developed under different moisture conditions. The \nrelationship is adjusted by moisture factor, which is designed to modulate the evaporation \neffects on rain below cloud base for different moisture environments. The amount of \nmoisture factor will also determine the growth factor along with the successive image data. \nThus the final rainfall equations will be different for different RH and PW amounts so that \nthe real time PW and RH data can be ingested properly with a priori knowledge well \nestablished for the region of study/operation. \nStep 5: Calibration and validation and  Fine Tuning of algorithm: \nFinally the retrieved rainfall from earlier steps and  Doppler Weather Radar data on available \nlocations in India would be used both for calibration and validation of the algorithm. The \nerror analysis will be carried out and accordingly the algorithm will be fine tuned. A \ncomplete error statistics (regression, correlation, RMSE, BIAS, Mean, Standard Deviation \netc.) will be performed for the desired period (validation period of about 3-4 months). \n \nStep 6: Generation of Rainfall maps: \nRainfall maps on every 3 hourly and daily basis on 0.50 x0.50 and bigger grid spacing will be \nproduced with all provisions to have maximum possible information (like contours, color \nshades, statistical information etc.). Based on this algorithm QPE on  daily, pentad,  monthly \nmean, seasonal mean and annual mean will be produced. The capability of to derive QPE \nfrom IMSRA over meteorological subdivisions will be attempted along with Image Analysis \nSystem Group. Accordingly the algorithm will be made operational after due testing and \nvalidation. \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n59\n4.4.1.2.2 Flow Chart for IMSRA Algorithm \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.4.1.3 Operational Implementation Steps for QPE from IMSRA \nStep 1 : Conversion from gray count to BT: With the calibration and geolocation \ninformation the raw counts are to be converted into the brightness temperatures at \ndifferent pixel locations respectively.  \nStep 2: Cloud Classification (Deep Convective (DC), DC with/without thin Cirrus \n(DCC), Mid to upper level clods with/without thin Cirrus using an IR and WV  channels. \nINSAT TIR, WV  Data \n3 Hourly Image \nConversion from Grey \nCount to TBs \nLook Up Table for \nCalibration \nGrid Average  of  \nIR TBs (0.250x0.250) \nCollocation of IR TBs \nand TRMM/ SSM/I \nRainfall \nEstimation of Rainfall \n \nIR and WV - Cloud Classification \n (Deep Convective (DC),  \nDC with/without thin Cirrus (DCC), \nMid to upper level clods \nwith/without thin Cirrus and others \nPW & RH Correction \nCorrected Rainfall \nEstimation  \nRain - Daily, Pentad, \nmonthly, seaonal \nIMD Model PW  \n& RH Forecast \nSatellite Microwave \nRainfall (TRMM/SSMI) \nGrid Avg.

The hourly rainfall from rain gauges and DWRs and the IMD \nmodel forecasts from IMD in proper grid sizes (3-6 hourly, 0.5x0.5 deg. grid) are \nessential. In addition, the advanced approach suggested here to use satellite microwave \ninformation to augment thermal IR  rainfall measurements along with VIS and WV \nwould also require a large R & D effort (in terms of man hours).  \n4.5 \nOutputs \nParameter \nUnit \nMin \nMax \nAccuracy \nResolution \nQPE (GPI) \n \nHistogram \nof BT’s  \nDaily, Pentad, \nMonthly & seasonal \nrainfall \nmm \n \n     K \n \n  mm \n0 \n \n  < 180 K \n \n     0 \n72 mm/ day \n \n   > 280 K \n \n 72 mm/day \n   TBD \n \n   24 Class   \n \n    TBD \n1.0x1.0 and \n0.5x0.5 deg \n  1.0 x 1.0  \n \n  1.0 x 1.0 \nQPE (IMSRA) \n \nHistogram \nof BT’s  \n \nDaily, Pentad, \nMonthly & Seasonal \nrainfall \nmm     \n \n \n K \n \n  mm \n0 \n \n \n< 170 K \n \n     0 \n TBD \n \n \n> 300 K \n \n  TBD \n TBD \n \n   \n 24 Class  \n  \n    TBD \n1.0x1.0 and \n0.5x0.5 deg \n \n   -- do  --  \n \n   -- do  -- \n4.5.1 Format of the output and the domain \nBasic format would be to obtain QPE on a give domain with geolocation, and rainfall  values. \nHowever, the QPE would  be represented in various shades, contours and with        desired \ncolor coding thereof.

These are required to be used for many diverse meteorological, \nclimate, hydrological, agricultural, and other applications. It is therefore important to have an \nidea of their accuracy and expected error characteristics. This is done by validating the \nsatellite precipitation estimates against \"ground truth\" from rain gauge and radar observations. \nA thorough verification of satellite-based precipitation products should quantify their \naccuracy in a wide range of weather and climate regimes, give users information on the \nexpected errors in the estimates, help algorithm developers understand the strengths and \nweaknesses of the satellite rainfall algorithms. To get good estimates of absolute accuracy \nsatellite products are verified against very high quality radar and gauge data. However, these \nsites are only few in number. To get estimates of regional and spatial accuracy it is necessary \nto use a much larger quantity of data, for example, from national rain gauge networks. While \nthese verification data are less reliable than those from high-quality sites, their errors are \nusually much smaller than those associated with the satellite estimates, at least on short time \nscales. For validation of QPE with the ground truth on different temporal and spatial scale are \nrequired mainly with the data of DWR and Rain Gauges. \n4.6.1 Data Required:  \nThe following data for validation will be needed  \nParameter \nResolution \nQuantization \nAccuracy \nSource \nDopple \nWeather Radar \n \n0.250x0.250  \n        \n-- \n \n-- \n \nIMD - \nAt all DWR \nlocations \n(Every 1 \nHourly basis \n0.250x0.250 \ngrids \n \nFast Response \nRain Gauges \n(for hourly \nrainfall) & \nOther Rain \ngauge Data \nRain/day \n \nGround Truth \n(over land and \noceans) point \nobservation \n \n-- \n \n-- \n \nIMD - \nAt all Daily \nobservation \nsites and to \nplan for \noceanic \nlocations \n \nTotal \nWater \nVapour \n \nRelative \n0.5 X 0.5 deg \n \n \n0.5 X 0.5 deg \n \n \n3-6 hourly Eta \n/IMD  Model \nAnalysis from \nIMD, (500 mb \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n62\nHumidity \n \n \nto surface) \n \n \nTRMM \nAnalysed Data \n \nOrbital and  \n 3 hourly -\n0.250x0.250 \nand 10 X 10 \n \n \n \nData available \nthrough \ninternet  \n4.6.2 Method of Validation: \nCurrently pulsed Doppler technique are applied in weather radars to map severe storm \nreflectivity and velocity structure with great success in showing in real time the development \nof cyclones providing quantitative measure of intensity, track and information on winds \nwithin and around the storm. By studying the characteristics of radar returns and analyzing \nthe variations in their amplitude (or power received) , phase or frequency shift or change in \npolarization state, DWR quantifies the different characteristics of the precipitating medium \nwithin the pulse volume. The amount of received power from the distributed target depends \non the number of particles within the pulse volume of the beam, their size, composition, \nshape, orientation etc. \n The DWR’s are located at Kolkatat, Chennai, Muchlipattanm and Shri-Harikota \n(SHAR). The SHAR radar is S-band and Doppler. It is situated as an Island north of Chennai. \nAll are working operationally.  DWR’s estimates 3 base products namely Reflectivity (Z), \nVelocity (V) and Spectrum Width (W) as a function of range. From these base products, \nadvanced data products are required to be generated to meet the validation needs. \nGround-based radar and gauge rainfall observations (from IMD, ISRO’s AWS etc), at \nhigh resolution (hourly), are thus required to be used for validating rain  product. High \nresolution IMD DWR products (hourly 4 Km x 4 Km) is required for evaluation over several \nsmall size study sites with hourly (daily when hourly is not available) rain-gauge density, for \ninstance in 1°x 1° degrees. The size of every validation study site varies from 0.5°x 0.5° to \n2°x 2° degrees, depending on the density and distribution of available hourly rain-gauge \nstations over the study site and horizontal rain extents. In case of proper validation of GPI \nrainfall in particular, which is for a grid size of 1.00 x1.00, there should be minimum 3 rain \ngauges (IMD or AWS) to average out for comparison within a GPI grid size. For IMSRA, an \nhourly, and  daily DWR and rain gauge information would be required on routine basis, \npreferably in 0.250x0.250 or atleast in 0.5°x0.5° grids.  \nPre-launch Field Experiments \nPre-launch validation campaign will be launched for existing Kalpana, INSAT-3A \nbased rainfall algorithms as a prelude to INSAT-3D. A three months period will be selected \n(mainly rainy season) for collecting data from DWRs, all possible and quality assured rain \ngauges and the algorithm will be tested. \nPost-Launch Special Field Experiments \nMany of the present ground-truth observations data networks are being augmented  \nfor the measurements of precipitation on ground. This includes the plans of IMD to put more \nDWR in various Indian regions. However, the existing ground based data sources will be \nutilized for the INSAT-3D Imager derived  rainfall estimates. Some more details of the \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n63\nvalidation campaigns (timing, location, instrumentation, etc.) will be decided later in mutual \nconsultation with IMD. \n4.7 \nTechnical Issues: (Limitation etc.) \nThe approaches for the retrieval of rainfall from these two techniques are distinctly different  \nwith different application  areas in mind by NOAA. Thus the validity of these methods in \nIndian Tropical Regions is an important and still an open issue. For large scale rainfall GPI \ntechnique has been found suitable over tropical regions and can be implented.  \nHowever, the inherent limitations of IR / VIS based methods due to their indirect \nmeasurements poses challenges for the accuracy of the rainfall products. More importantly \nGMSRA is the algorithms, which is a large effort from various scientific institutions put \ntogether for many years and then integrated at NOAA. To follow them for the algorithm \ndevelopment directly over tropical regions of India needs a lot of R & D, experience and \ninnovations pertaining to the region. It is because, some of the steps like the cloud \nmicrophysics (estimation of effective radius of cloud particles, their optical properties etc.) \nand associated parameters estimation are the important but grey areas of research and can be \naccomplished fully only with the R&D efforts and experience in the field. \nIn addition the GMSRA, however, is a highly specific to US regions particularly with very \nlarge spatial and temporal coverage’s of the background data of Doppler Weather Radars (as \na dominant characteristics of the algorithm) along with the satellite data. In case of GMSRA, \nsome of the efforts are highly innovative (optical and cloud microphysics) and as mentioned \nearlier we have proposed to alternatively apply some some advanced elements   in our \nproposed IMSRA algorithm, so that the method is more prone to Indian tropical regions. \nHowever, the advanced approach suggested here to use microwave information from most \nrecent satellites like low/polar orbiting TRMM/SSM/I to augment thermal IR  rainfall \nmeasurements along with VIS and WV channels from Geostationary satellite would also \nrequire large R & D efforts. \n4.8 \nFuture Scope \nDue to the heterogeneity of precipitation over the Earth’s surface it is important that \ncorrections be applied time to time to the algorithms depending on region specific processes. \nConventional means are restricted primarily to certain-land regions, and although satellite \nmeasurements are now commonly available, these have limitations too. Frequent \nobservations from visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) sensors are hindered by the fact that \nestimates of precipitation are indirect and therefore prone to errors caused by cloud-top to \nsurface rainfall variations. More direct measurements of precipitation through the use of \npassive microwave (PMW) instruments are somewhat restricted due their relative infrequent \nsampling of precipitation. Thus the algorithms for merging of microwave data with IR \nimages to generate rainfall rates at the spatial and temporal resolutions of the IR sensor is \nhighly desirable. The combined approaches can improve rainfall estimates using the temporal \nsampling of the VIS/IR data and the more direct nature of the microwave estimates, avoiding \nthe mentioned weaknesses and re-inforce the mutual strengths. At present we have proposed \nto use Geostationary optical channels and low earth orbiting microwaves for the rainfall \nestimation by their inter-calibration process and finally validations with the ground truth. In \nfuture this approach can be further advanced by optimally integrating optical and microwave \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n64\nmeasurements by proper data assimilation schemes which will provide better rainfall than \nany of the sensors (optical, microwave and ground truth) alone. \n4.9 \nReferences \n1.

Rain systems, \nsuch as hurricanes, typhoons, monsoons, and fronts are crucial to sustaining the livelihood of \nmany countries. Excess rainfall can cause flood, property and crop damages. A deficiency \ncauses drought and crop failure. Flood is a disaster that often resulted from intense \nprecipitation in short time. Floods are among the most devastating national hazards in the \nworld, claiming more lives and causing more property damage than any other natural \nphenomena. Within the USA an average of more than 225 people are killed and more than \n$3.5 billion in property is damaged by heavy rain and flooding each year (1993, 1999).  \nThese figures are more devastating for India with population over 1 billion.  As of today, the \nfloods is one the greatest challenges in weather prediction. \nConventionally rainfall over the ground is measured using rain gauges and radar. Rain \ngauges offer point measurements and thus they do not represent spatial variability of the \nprecipitation that varies from few meters to several kilometers. The distribution of the rain \ngauges is far from adequate to present the meaningful variability for the study of various \nrain-induced events/processes, like flash flood, dam failure, river catchment, etc.  On the \nother hand, radars are better representative of the areal rain, but their coverage is limited due \nto their high cost. The radar measurements often suffer due to poor calibration of radar \nreflectivity and also of Ze-R relationship. Apart from that, ground clutter and anomalous \npropagation also mars its usability. At the time of severe weather conditions, ground based \nobservation network often failed to work. In view of the limitations of the ground \nmeasurements, the most convenient means to measure the precipitation over large area is by \nusing the satellite-based methods. The satellites offer frequent uniform coverage over large \narea. However, the satellite measurements also suffer from large errors. While Vis./IR \nmethods suffer from their inability to sense hydrometeors (Bhandari and Varma, 1995), \nmicrowave measurements suffer due to so called beam filling problem, and uncertainty in the \ndrop-size distribution, drop temperature, fall velocity and shape and orientation of the drops \n(Varma et al, 2003, 2004 and Varma and Liu, 2006).  \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n68\nIn this document, a new most advanced method is described for precipitation measurement. \nThis method called Hydro-Estimator (H-E) method is developed by Robert Kuligowaski \nutilizes the infrared (IR) measurements from a geostationary satellite and is operationally \nused at NOAA/NESDIS. \n4.2.1 Overview and Background  \nScofield (1987) described a method for measuring the intense precipitation over a storm. His \nmethod called Interactive Flash Flood Analyzer (IFFA) that used half-hourly satellite images \nto measure the precipitation over the active area of a storm. His method utilized the skill of a \ntrained meteorologist to find out active portion of a storm. His method also utilized the \nprecipitable water (PW) and water vapour (WV) correction to make modifications for \ndry/wet environment and saturation level adjustments for rain that comes from the warm \nclouds. This method was very successful for precipitation measurement but was highly \nsubjective and needed continuous interaction of a trained meteorologist to decide the \nprecipitation amount. Due to this reason, it was not very easy to implement it with ease.  \nSuccessively, an alternate method called Auto-Estimator was developed. The aim of the \nAuto-Estimator was to provide an automated method without human intervention and that \ncould take care of the subjective nature of the IFFA, but this method a failed on many \noccasions because many features of IFFA were not properly implemented in it. Hydro-\nEstimator is most recent of the attempts by NESDIS to improve and make IFFA automated. \nThe H-E incorporated many new features that were either not present in IFFA or were \ndefined differently. \nTill date there is no published literature on H-E method is available (or known to us). The \nmethod/procedure described in this document is based on pre-prints of a paper and personal \ncommunication with Dr. Robert Kuligowaski who pioneered in developing H-E method at \nNOAA/NESDIS. \n4.2.2 Objectives: \n To develop Hydro-Estimator method for precipitation measurement over Indian \nregion encompassing area between longitudes 30 E -to130 E and latitudes 50 N - \n50 S. \n4.3 \nInputs \n4.3.1 Static Data: \nTopography data – Etopo – topography/elevation data from NGDC (USA). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n69\n4.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) \nParameter \nResolution \nQuantization \nAccuracy \nSource \nRadiometric and \ngeometric \ncorrected gray \ncount values of \nTIR-1 channel \n(10.7 m) \nSpatial:pixel \nTemporal: \n30 min \n10 bit \n- \nDerived from \nraw data by \nDP \nGray value to \nbrightness \ntemperature \nconversion table \n- \n- \n0.3 K \nDerived by \nDP \nGeolocation file \nSpatial:pixel \nTemporal: \n30 min \n- \n1 pixel \nDerived by \nDP \n \n4.3.3 Other Auxillary data and Model Inputs \n \nParameter \nResolution \nQuantization \nAccuracy \nSource \nEta Model - \nEquilibrium \nlevel in K \nSpatial: pixel \nsize \nTemporal: \n3/6 hourly \n  \n \nProvided by \nIMD \nEta model- \nobservations of \nwind at 850 hPa \nand relative \nhumidity (%), \nand PW (inch) \nSpatial: pixel \nsize \nTemporal: \n3/6 hourly \n \n \nProvided by \nIMD \nEta model -\nProfiles of \ntemperature and \ndew point. \nSpatial: pixel \nsize \nTemporal: \n3/6 hourly \n \n \nProvided by \nIMD \n \nIn RFP, IMD has proposed its own model instead of Eta model.

Identify areas of probable precipitation, through recognition of most rain/no-rain \nboundaries \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n70\n2. Evaluate associated rainrate \n3. Combine (1) and (2) through time where estimates of total accumulated rainfall are \nrequired \nThe objective of present day satellite research is blending of different types of data, from \nboth satellite and non-satellite sources, into the `best possible’ rainfall product. \nRainfall estimation using Visible and IR satellite rainfall algorithm - physical premise \n1. In the  visible region of the spectrum the basic physical assumption is that cloud \nbrightness is an indicator of cloud thickness, and this inturn is an indicator of rainfall. \nUnfortunately these relationships are neither simple nor constant; for example, because \nby no means all bright clouds precipitate. \n2. In the thermal IR, the basic physical premise is that cloud top temperature is a function of \ncloud top height, and that higher and colder cloud tops evidence thicker clouds which are \nmore likely to rain. While this set of relationship is more often true than (1) above, \nunfortunately not all cold clouds precipitate, nor does rain always come from cold clouds. \n \nPhysical explanation of rainfall with infrared (IR) images \n \nThe satellite IR images are composed of measured radiant energy originating in the \natmosphere or from the land and water surface below. The intensity of this energy integrated \nover all wavelength, by Stefan-Boltzmann law, is proportional to fourth power of \ntemperature. The Stefan-Boltzmann law is valid for a perfect black body. If the medium \nemits spectral radiant energy according to some temperature less than its thermal temperature, \nthan a second factor called emissivity is introduced. The emissivity of a body determines its \nemission efficiency. Thus, we can define brightness temperature of a body Tb,  which is \nrelated to its physical  temperature is T by following equation:   \nTb =  T \nwhere,  is emissivity of the object. If.  = 1, Tb = T, its a black body; if  = 0, Tb = 0, its a \nwhite body; if 0 <  < 1, Tb < T, and its a gray body.  \nThe IR, for rainfall estimation, refers to thermal IR band that is 10.0 - 12.5 m. This is a \natmospheric window, and all earthly objects radiate maximum spectral power in this band. In \nthis band the absorption is strong for clouds and land/water surfaces and slight for gaseous \nconstituents of the atmosphere. For surfaces, which are opaque and do not transmit radiation, \nmeasured intensity is closely approximated by the fourth power of the temperature. For those \nsurfaces, which are not   opaque - such as some clouds - measured intensity is approximated \nby effective emissivity times fourth power of the temperature. This effective emissivity will \nbe referred more often as cloud emissivity here after. The cloud emissivity   cannot be \nmeasured from observations at a single wavelength interval. Often it is simply assumed to be \nunity. Then the temperature calculated from observed intensity of radiation is called \n`brightness temperature’. Only when  = 1, brightness temperature equals to black body \ntemperature. \nThe value of IR measurements to rainfall estimate lies in the nearly universal condition of \nlapse of temperature with height through the troposphere. If the temperature is known with \nheight, either from actual sounding or from climatology, the height of the cloud can be \ninfrared from the satellite IR observations. Ordinarily, gray clouds are not useful in this \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n71\ncontext, because  < 1 implies clouds which are thin (and therefore without precipitation). \nThe more serious problem is distinguishing between cold clouds that are radiometrelly thick \nbut are confined to the upper and middle troposphere, and cold clouds that extend into lower \ntroposphere.  \nPhysical explanation of rainfall with visible (vis) images \nIn middle and late fifties and earlier sixties, various researches concluded that with thicker \nclouds the probability of rainfall and rain intensity is increased. This relationship is strongest \nfor clouds warmer than -15° C. It is also noted that marine clouds produce heavier rainfall. \nThe possible explanation for this lies in the process of cloud growth and droplet growth rates. \nIn clouds warmer than -15° C, precipitation results from coalescence. The large cloud \nthickness allows more time for growth before droplets fall out of the cloud. However, the \nother factors like droplet concentration, evaporation and cloud temperature are also important. \nDifference in precipitation probability between marine and continental clouds were attributed \nto difference in concentration of condensation nuclei and of droplets, and difference in \nevaporation below the cloud base. Very high droplet concentrations (> 400 cm3) inhibit \ncoalescence and formation of rain. The evaporation of raindrops is proportional to saturation \nvapor deficit and fall period. Both droplet concentration and subcloud moisture and thickness \nare more variable over land than over water. Temperature governs various processes. At \ntemperature   -10° C growth of hydrometeors is dominated by sublimation and collisions \ninvolving ice particles; that is, by Wegener-Bergeron rather than coalescence processes. Less \nimportant factors influencing precipitation are condensation nuclei, updraft speed, and \nelectrification. Thus cloud thickness, though important, is one of the several factors \ndetermining production of rain in the clouds.  \nVarious researchers have tried to related cloud thickness with satellite observed brightness. \nThe contradictory claims are made. Some of them have found high correlation between two, \nwhere as others could not notice so encouraging results with their studies. It is concluded that \ncloud brightness alone cannot always imply cloud thickness. In more than one instance, \nErickson and Hubert (1961) found in their study that large thunderstorms having vertical \ndepths of the order of 30000 feet appeared no brighter, than a rather dense overcast of much \nsmaller vertical extent. \n The understanding of the factors governing cloud brightness is complicated as it is a \nproblem of optics that again requires an excursion into the theory of electromagnetic \nradiation. \nThe light scattering from water clouds can be described as a problem of effect of light \nscattering by particles of size comparable or slightly more than the wavelength of the \nincident light. For water clouds, the particles (or droplets) may vary in size (the number of \nparticles as a function of their size), and the cloud geometry is variable (the arrangement of \nparticles in relation to the incident beam of solar radiation). This problem is generally treated \nin two parts: single scattering and multiple scattering.  \nThe single scattering theory describes the fate of incident light in a very small part of a \nnatural cloud. The aggregate effect on the incident beam of all parts of a cloud is treated \nthrough the theory of multiple scattering. Here, the dimensions of the cloud and its \norientation with respect to a given incident beam become important.  \n \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n72\nTwomey et al. (1967) calculated reflectance as a function of geometric thickness for a cloud \ndrop distribution of 6 m average radius and 1 m standard deviation. Liquid water content \nwas 0.2 and 0.4 gm- 3, and two solar zenith angles were considered.  They found that \nreflectance increases rapidly in hyperbolic fashion for both values of liquid water content, \nimplying little additional increase above the thickness of 0.7 km. The effect of absorption \nwas to increase the rate of hyperbolic convergence. Changing solar zenith angle had little \neffect (though at large zenith angles reflectance would approach unity), and the effects on \nreflectance of changing drop size distribution radius and variance were small for optical \nthickness,  > 100. \n \nThe radiance (brightness) from the striated cloud is larger than plan parallel radiance in \nantisolar direction with inclined illumination (Wending, 1977). Wending tested two drop size \ndistributions, one peaking at r ~ 5 m and other at 5 ~ 2 m, both appropriate to stratus \nclouds. The difference in albedo and radiance at small zenith angles were comparable to \ndifferences resulting from geometry of the cloud top; however, these also decreased with \nincreasing optical thickness. Therefore, at optical thickness typical of precipitating clouds, \ntexture and drop size distribution may be of secondary importance in explaining cloud \nbrightness. McKee and Klehr (1978) with their RT (radiative transfer) model found that \ncloud geometry is far more important factor than drop size distribution.  \n \nA composite picture emerging out of various studies in the past has proved the main factors \ngoverning cloud brightness are: \n thickness \n the area to volume ratio \n orientation of solar beam \n \nThese factors collectively called geometry, determine optical path within the cloud. Drop size \ndistribution and liquid water content are secondary in importance.  Background albedo may \nbe significant over land areas. Interactions apparently are important when clouds are close \ntogether. The phase is not appears to be an important variable. \n \nThe proposed method is the H-E method as developed at NOAA/NESDIS.  The details of \nthis method are described in the next section. \nRetrieval Algorithm Method \nThe H-E method described in this section is based on pre-prints of a paper by Kuligowaski et \nal. (2003). This paper is received from the author through personal communication.  \n \nThe H-E method offers improvement over A-E method for precipitation estimation. In A-E \nmethod, the relationship between 10.7 m brightness temperature (Tb10.7) and rain rate (mm \nh-1) (R) is defined as:  \n \nR = a exp(-bTb\n12\n10.7),                                            -----(1) \n \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n73\nwhere, a and b are regression coefficients having values a= 1.1183*1011; b=0.036382 \n(Vicente et al. 1995). The A-E method provides same relationship for convective and non-\nconvective precipitation. The above equation provides first guess of the precipitation value.  \n \nIn H-E method, convective and non-convective cores are identified and different R-Tb \nrelationships are provided for them. This allows higher precipitation rates for the convective \ncores. For convective core, an equation similar to (1) is used, however the coefficients a and \nb are varied as per precipitable water (PW) provided by Eta model. This allows higher \nprecipitation value for wetter atmosphere. The above (1) is constrained such a way that it \nyields a value of 0.5 mm h-1 of rain rate at 240 K, and a precipitable water (from Eta model) \ndependent  value at 210 K of Tb10.7. In H-E method, the maximum possible rain value at any \npixel is limited depending upon availability of PW. This allows the maximum precipitation to \nbecome a function of available moisture. The maximum possible rain value in mm h-1 is \ngiven as 40 times the precipitable water in inches.  \n \nIf a pixel is assigned maximum rain but there exist a colder pixel in its vicinity. In principle, \nthe rain rate at the colder nearby pixel would be higher. Thus the rain rate curves are \nrecomputed based on rain rate of 0.5 mm/h at 240 K and of the theoretical maximum value at \nthe lowest temperature in the vicinity. \n \nFoa a non-convective core, the relationship between Tb10.7 and Rs is given as: \n \nRs=(250-Tb10.7) * (Rmax/5)                  -----------------(2) \n \nRmax is again a function of PW. The relationship between Rmax and PW is not known in this \ncase and needs to be determined.  Rs is not allowed to exceed - corresponding convective rain \nrate (Rc) or 12 mm h-1, whichever is lower. \n \nThe relationship between Eta model derived PW and R (in mm h-1) at 210 K is shown in \nfigure 1(a). The figures 1 (b) and 1(c) shows the relationship between R and Tb10.7 at \ndifferent PW values for convective and non-convective cores, respectively.  These figures are \ntaken from the pre-prints of Kuligowaski et al. (2003).  \n \nIn H-E method, the precipitation at a pixel is allowed to be combination of both convective \nand non-convective core.  This is worked out by considering a pixel box of 101X101 pixels \nsurrounding the pixel of interest. The minimum, mean and standard deviation of Tb10.7 (Tmin ),  \nin this pixel box is determined. This Tmin is used to find the radius of actual region of interest. \nWithin this radius of interest, the mean (Tmean) and standard deviation () of Tbm10.7 is \ndetermined. The active/inactive and also core/non-core fraction of the pixel is determined \nthrough the parameter Z, which is defined as: \nZ = (Tmean- Tb10.7)/           ----------(3) \nThe maximum allowable value of Z is 1.5.   \n \nIf Z < 0;  R = 0, i.e., pixel either cirrus or inactive convective \nOtherwise, RR = [Rc*Z2 + Rn * (1.5 - Z)2] / [Z2 + (1.5 - Z)2]    --------------(3) \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n74\nRc is the rain from the convective core given by (1) with coefficients determined by PW from \nEta model. Rn is rain from non-convective core given by  (2). If Z=1.5, the pixel rain rate RR \nreduces to convective type only (given by (1)). On the other hand, if Z=0, the pixel rain rate \nRR is determined by purely non-convective rain (given by (2)). \n \n In fact, the convective systems generally have multiple brightness temperature minima, and \nhence a single radius is inappropriate for differentiating local from global minima. Thus, this \nsame computation of rain rate is performed for a smaller (15-pixel) radius, and the final rain \nrate is the square root of the product of the two rates. The exception to this is if the rain rate \ncomputed from the smaller radius is zero, in which case it is not considered in the final rain \nrate calculation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe (3) above provides the first guess precipitation amounts. The precipitation thus estimated \nis further modified to account for the wetness/dryness of the atmosphere and also for the \nprecipitation that comes from the warm clouds. The several steps involved for such \nmodifications are as follows: \n \n(a) Correction for Wet/dry Environment \nA small correction in the brightness temperature (Tb10.7) values is carried out to account for \nwetness of the environment. This adjustment is needed to account for evaporation of the \nprecipitation in the dryer environment below the cloud. A higher or lower value of the \nbrightness temperature at 10.7m is set for dry or wetter environment.  This is carried out in \ntwo steps. In the first step, brightness temperature is adjusted based on the PW value to \ncompute rain rate from (3). This is shown in Fig. 2 (a), where brightness temperature \ncorrection is additive or subtractive depends upon value of PW. In the second step, first, the \n(This figure is taken from the pre-prints of Kuligowski et al. (2003)) \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n75\nRH itself from the Eta model is adjusted to account for the falling rain, and then depending \nupon RH value, a subtraction from the rain amount given by (3) is made.  Fig. 2(b) shows the \ncorrection of RH as a function of rain.  Fig. 2(c) shows the correction rain amount as a \nfunction of corrected RH. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(This figure is taken from the pre-prints of Kuligowski et al. (2003)) \n \n(b) Warm-top modification \n \nThe equilibrium level is computed by following a parcel along a saturation adiabat upward \n(from lifting condensation level) to where the parcel temperature becomes equal to the \nenvironmental temperature. Strength of the convection is determined by a comparing the \ntemperatures of the convective tops with that of equilibrium level. This level comes before \ntropopause for the warm rain. \n \nIn H-E method, Eta model temperature and dewpoint profiles are used to determine \nequilibrium temperature of a particulate pixel. This correction is applied to pixels that are \nwarmer than the equilibrium level temperature.   \n \n If  the (Teq- Tmin) < 10 K, then Tmin in the pixel-area is used instead of Tb10.7 of the \npixel for warm top correction.   The modification is as follows: \n \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n76\nTb10.7 – [(213-Teq)*0.9] or 25 K (whichever less) \n If the (Teq- Tmin) > 10 K, the modification is as follows \nTb10.7  – [(213-Teq)*0.6] or 15 K (whichever less) \n \n(c) Orography and Parallax correction \n \nOrography adjustment is carried out using 850 –hPa Winds and topography from a digital \nelevation model at 4 km resolution to derive vertical component of wind (Vicente et al., \n2002). This vertical wind component is then scaled into a multiplicative adjustment to the \nrain rate. \nThe parallax correction described in the same paper, adjusts the horizontal location of the \nsatellite pixel prior to rain rate computation, based on cloud height (using Tb and standard \natmosphere) and satellite zenith angle. \nSatellite Zenith angle correction is carried out to take into accounts the increased path length \nat higher angles.  A technique developed by Joyce et al. (2001) is used. \n \nDerived Products \nPrecipitation rain rate at 30 minute duration. \nIntegrated daily, weekly and monthly precipitation amounts. \n \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n77\n4.4.1.2 Flow Chart \n \n \n \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n78\n \n \n \n \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n79\n4.5 \nOutputs \n \nParameter \nUnit \nMin. \nMax.

The \nrain is known to have variability from few meters to continental scales and from few seconds to any \ntime scale. In shorter measuring scales, it behaves as quasi-random stochastic process. Therefore, rain \ncomparisons in shorter time scales and from observations in different spatial scales lead to large \nerrors (Piyush et al., 2012). Nevertheless, we have compared daily 0.25ox0.25o averaged rain from \nmodified H-E method with gridded dataset from IMD. The comparisons of H-E and 3B42 V7 are \ncarried out with IMD gridded dataset for each of the met subdivisions as provided in Table 1.6.3 to \ntable 1.6.4.  \n \nTable 1.6.3: Comparison statistics of 0.25ox0.25o daily gridded rain from H-E and IMD in \neach met subdivisions. \n \nMet Sub Division R \nrmse  bias \nMet Sub Division \nR \nrmse  bias \nArunachal Pradesh 0.26   43.63    -5.87 \nEast MP \n0.45   30.11   -7.24 \nAssam & Megha. \n0.52   46.41    -3.34 \nGuj, DNH & Dam. \n0.42   19.02   1.66 \nNMMT \n0.17   28.77    -6.89 \nSaur., Katch & Diu \n0.39   13.54   0.43 \nSHWB \n0.22   38.85    0.84 \nKonkan & Goa \n0.44   43.31   8.26 \nGangetic WB \n0.41   23.45    -4.51 \nMadhya Maha \n0.39   34.42   -7.83 \nOrissa \n0.51   31.85    -5.05 \nMarathwada \n0.46   27.38   -6.36 \nJharkhand \n0.57   26.48    -8.14 \nVidarbh \n0.57   23.43   -3.93 \nBihar \n0.63   18.70    -2.30 \nChattisgarh \n0.61   26.18   -5.55 \nEast UP \n0.56   20.82    -4.61 \nCoastal AP \n0.32   25.28   -4.64 \nWest UP \n0.45   16.03    -2.86 \nTelengana \n0.40   18.04   -2.77 \nUttrakhand  \n0.36   34.28    -3.33 \nRayalaseema \n0.51   9.15    -1.17 \nHR., Chd. & Delhi \n0.39   10.43    -1.25 \nTN & Pondicherry \n0.34   12.65   -2.46 \nPunjab \n0.45   9.16     0.21 \nCoastal Karnataka \n0.51   47.31   -3.04 \nHP \n0.30   31.83    -2.97 \nN.I.

This is mainly due to spatially averaged measurement \nof rain from H-E and TRMM TRMM-3B42 V7. The Table 1.6.5 also shows the performance \nof modified H-E with respect to TRMM 3B42 V7 over oceans. It may be noted here that \nneither IMD WWR nor gridded dataset provides measurements over oceans. So the \ncomparison with TRMM 3B42 V7 is the only source for accessing the quality of H-E rain \nover oceans. It may be noted from Table 12 that daily 0.25ox0.25o gridded rain from H-E and \n3B42 V7 has a good agreement over oceans with correlation of 0.65 and rmse of 15.88 \nmm/day.

The changes that are carried out in the modified algorithm are \nable to successfully represent the orographic rain which otherwise was not found to suffer \nfrom huge errors. The rain is highly variable parameter over space and time and its validation \nin smaller scales always resulting large huge errors (Piyush et al., 2012). The results \npresented above should be viewed with respect to validation comparison results of the global \nstandard rain products by other researchers. For example, in a recent study by Tan et al. \n(2015) in which they evaluated six high resolution precipitation products including TRMM-\n3B42 V7 over the Malaysia. They reported that among 5 satellite based rain products, the \n3B42 V7 and is the best performing with respect to surface observations, which on daily \nscale provides a correlation of 0.39 and rmse of 18.35 mm/day. While the India has much \nmore diverse surface and climatic conditions with different cloud types and wide range of \nprecipitation rates during S-W months, we achieve much higher correlation between \nmodified H-E rain with surface observations. A more important aspect of the rain from H-E \nvis-à-vis TRMM 3B42 V7 is timely availability of H-E product from IMD and MOSDAC \nsites. The TRMM 3B42 V7 is available after latency of about 4 months, whereas INSAT-3D \nH-E is available within 15 minutes of data acquisition, which makes H-E very important for \noperational users, especially those working with rain related natural disasters, nowcasting \nand numerical weather predictions. \n4.7 \nFuture Scope \nThe scheme has to be regularly calibrated with more varied calibration data. Further merging \nof H-E with microwave observations is desired for more accrate rain measurement. \n4.9 \nReferences \n1. Barrett, E. c., and D. W.

The inheritance of \nthis satellite has come from GOES series of NOAA. Meteorological payloads onboard \nwould be a 6 channel imager and a 19 channel sounder mainly for cyclone and monsoon \nmonitoring, cloud motion vectors winds, rainfall estimation, floods/intense precipitation \nmonitoring, snow cover detection, mesoscale studies etc. 19 channel Sounder, split \nthermal window channels, a mid IR thermal window channel and shortwave IR channel \nare the additions to earlier INSAT-3A/Kalpana satellites. Details of Imager channels are \ngiven in Table-1. \nSea surface temperature would be derived from split thermal window channels (10.2-\n11.3m, 11.5 –12.5m) during daytime and using additional mid IR window channel (3.7 \n– 4.1m) during nighttime over cloud free oceanic regions. The most important part of \nthe SST retrieval from IR observations is the atmospheric correction. Specially over \ntropics, this atmospheric correction is dominated by the high variability in vertical \ndistribution of the intervening atmospheric water vapor. This correction will be \ndetermined through suitable characterization of tropical atmospheres in radiative transfer \nmodel to simulate the brightness temperatures of INSAT-3D channels and then \ngenerating the regression coefficients for SST retrieval. Details of the algorithm have \nbeen given in section 1.4.1.1. \n \n5.2.1 Overview and background \nThis algorithm basis theoretical document (ATBD) describes our current working \nmodels of the algorithms for the retrieval of sea surface temperature from INSAT-3D  \nimager channels data. While effort has been made to make this document as complete as \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n88\npossible, it should be recognized that algorithm development is an evolving process. This \ndocument (V1.0) is a description of the prototype algorithm for INSAT-3D sea surface \ntemperature estimation as it currently exists, and is being delivered for inclusion in the \nINSAT-3D processing scheme. \nCurrent research on the physics of the atmospheric transmission in the infrared, the \nprocesses at the ocean surface, and new information about the performance of the satellite \nwill lead to periodic revisions of the algorithms. Also, the document may appear \nincomplete in places as research continues to improve our understanding of the processes \nat work. Subsequent revisions of the document will reflect new knowledge and, it is \nhoped, fill the gaps in what is reported here. \n \n5.2.2 Objective \nDevelopment of complete application software package for derivation of SST using multi \nchannel Imager data from INSAT-3D. \n5.3 Inputs \n5.3.1 Static Data  \nParameter \nResolution \nAccuracy \nSource \nLand /Sea Mask  Pixel ( ~4 km) \n1 pixel \n \nUSGS(available) \n \n5.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) \n \nParameter \nResolution \nQuantization \nAccuracy \nSource \nRadiometric and \ngeometric \ncorrected \ngray \ncount values of  \nChannel-5  \n(10.2-11.3 m) \npixel \n10 bit \n- \nDerived from \nraw data by \nDP \nRadiometric and \ngeometric \ncorrected \ngray \ncount values of  \n Channel-6 \n(11.5-12.5 m) \npixel \n10 bit \n- \nDerived from \nraw data by \nDP \nRadiometric and \ngeometric \ncorrected \ngray \ncount values of  \nChannel-3 \n (3.8 – 4.0 m) \npixel \n10 bit \n- \nDerived from \nraw data by \nDP \nGray value to \nbrightness \ntemperature \n- \n- \n0.3 K \nDerived \nby \nDP \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n89\nconversion \nlookup table \nGeolocation file \nPixel \n- \n1 pixel \nDerived \nby \nDP \nSatellite Zenith \nangle \npixel \n \n \nDerived \nby \nDP \nSolar \nZenith \nangle \npixel \n \n \nDerived \nby \nDP \nCloud Flag \nPixel \n- \n- \nCloud Routine \n \n5.3.3 Other Auxiliary data and Model Inputs \n \nParameter \nResolution \nAccuracy \nSource \nClimatological \nSSTdata \n1 X 1 deg \n0.5 K \nReynolds \nClimatological \nWV data \n1 X 1 deg \n5 mm \nNVAP \nTotal \nwater \nvapour \n(In \ncase \nof \nfailure of  any \none of the split \nthermal channel) \n0.5 X 0.5 \ndeg \n5 mm \nModel output, \nIMD \n \n5.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications \n5.4.1 Overview \n5.4.1.1 Theoretical Background \nRadiance from Earth’s terrestrial emission peaks at around 9.6 m and it has \nminimum absorption by atmospheric gases, hence in order to measure earth’s temperature, \nspaceborne sensors are designed around this band (8-12m). Still this band is not \ncompletely transparent. Atmospheric water vapour and CO2 are the major components \nthat attenuate the IR signal reaching at the top of the atmosphere. Since CO2 is a \nuniformly mixed gas, its effect can be taken care, but water vapour being highly variable \nits effect can only be removed by its measurement(directly or indirectly). Retrieval of sea \nsurface temperature (SST) from thermal infrared window channels (10-12 m) requires \natmospheric corrections arising due to attenuation of signal by intervening moisture. This \ncorrection is more in tropics during summers due to higher amount of atmospheric \nmoisture (Barton 1983, Anding and Kauth 1970, Gohil et al 1994, Mathur & Agarwal \n1991, 2002, Shenoy 1999). Our radiative transfer simulations studies have shown that \nwith proper characterization of tropical marine conditions in the atmosphere, a suitable \nalgorithm can be developed for accurate SST retrieval (<0.7K) using split thermal \nwindow and mid IR thermal channels provided the sensor noise is of the order of 0.1K. \nThe regression equation to correct for atmospheric absorption and emission has the form  \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n90\n \nSST= A0 + A1T11 + A2dT + A3dT2     \n \n \n \n(1) \nWhere A0, A1, A2 and  A3 are coefficients determined by simulation and may have satellite \nzenith angle dependence   \n          dT = T11 – T12  \n       T11 and T12 are brightness temperatures for the split-window channels. \n \nTo determine the regression coefficients in the above equation, radiative transfer \nsimulations to generate INSAT-3D channels’ brightness temperatures for Indian marine \ntropical environmental conditions would be carried out. The important step in regression \nis to ensure that the sample dataset is fully and solely representative of the population for \nwhich the SST is to be derived. Instrument noise in simulated data for INSAT-3D \nchannels would be introduced as per the availability from sensor team.  \nA case study for SST retrieval using GOES-9 data (19th August 2005) yielded 0.68 K \nRMS deviation.  \n5.4.1.1.1 Radiative Transfer Model \nTo simulate the brightness temperatures, MODTRAN  is being used. MODTRAN is a \ncomputer code developed by Spectral Sciences Inc. and is designed to determine \natmospheric transmittance and radiance at moderate resolution (1 cm-1). It is based on \nAFGL’s LOWTRAN-7 code. Thermodynamic Initial Guess Retrieval (TIGR) dataset has \nbeen used to construct the tropical marine subset. These profiles have been extracted \nfrom 500 S – 500 N and 300E – 1200E.  The simulations have been performed on each \nradio sounding of the TIGR \"tropical maritime\" subset under the following conditions: \n-TIGR profiles are available on 48 levels. They have been converted to the 34 level \nMODTRAN inputs by using directly the TIGR levels from the surface to 300 hPa (15 \nlevels), sampling every 4 levels above 300 hPa (5 levels are excluded this way) and \nremoving the upper 9 levels. \n-In addition to the profiles of temperature and water vapor of TIGR, mixed gases profiles \nfrom MODTRAN standard atmospheres have been added according to the time and \nlocation of each radiosounding. \n-No aerosols have been considered. \n-Satellite zenith angles: 4 values of the secant have been retained: 1., 1.5, 1.75, 2. This \nsampling aims to detect possible non linearities in the dependance of any given quantity \nin function of sec(). \n-Surface temperatures: For each radio sounding 3 surface temperatures have been \nassigned: Ta1000 (1000 mb air temperature), Ta1000+1C, Ta1000-1C. \n-Radiances have been simulated for INSAT-3A and INSAT-3D thermal channels (i.e. \n10.5-12.5 m, 10.3-11.3 m, 11.5-12.5 m, 3.7-4.1 m) with emissivity values \ncalculated from the tables of Masuda 1988 with a moderate wind speed of 5 ms-1 (see \ntable 1 below). They have been calculated for each channel as means of tabulated values \nat the central and neighbouring wavelengths to account for the width of the filter function. \nFor instance, emissivities for channels centred on 11 m were calculated as the mean \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n91\nvalues of emissivities at 10.5 and 11 m, etc. They were then interpolated in function of \nsec() and used with a step of 0.0025 induced. \nRadiances will be integrated for each channel with the filter functions provided by Sensor \nGroup and converted into radiative temperatures. \nThe simulations applied on the \"tropical maritime\" subset of TIGR produced 5820 cases. \nBefore being used to derive algorithms, the simulated radiative temperatures were filtered. \nTo keep the simulated temperatures within realistic limits, the following thresholds were \nfinally applied on the simulation file: \nTs-T11 > 0.5C \n-2C < Ts < 35C \nW > 0.5 g/cm2 \n \n5.4.1.1.2 Inversion Methods \nTo generate regression coefficients from the simulated brightness temperatures as per the \nform prescribed in equation (1), multiple regression using least square method will be \nadopted.  \n \n5.4.1.1.3 Single Channel SST retrieval \nIn case of failure in any one of the thermal split channels, provisions are provided to \nretrieve SST using single functional channel  (water vapour correction in that case will be \ncarried out by ingesting total water vapour content externally from model output, and \napplying water vapour dependent SST coefficients similar to SST retrieval from INSAT-\n3A/Kalpana data). If external total WV conetent is not available, climatological water \nvapor will be used. \nSingle channel SST is computed as  \nSST = a + b*Tb +c*WV \n     Where \nTb is brightness temperature of the IR imager channel, WV is total water vapour content, \na, b and c are regression coefficients generated through radiative transfer simulations and \nmay have satellite zenith angle dependence. \n      5.4.1.1.4 Cloud Detection \nIn the present algorithm, cloudy pixels are detected through thresholding and spatial \ncoherence techniques in thermal band and the pixels are rejected based on the above \ncriterion. Thresholding technique assumes that over oceans in Indian domain brightness \ntemperature in thermal band is greatly affected by the presence of clouds, resulting in \ndecreased brightness temperature from cold cloud tops. Spatial coherence method is \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n92\nbased on the assumption that SST is homogeneous and warmer than clouds; thus clouds \ncan be identified where the scene brightness temperature has lower mean value or larger \nstandard deviation. Further, the cloud flags generated by cloud mask routine will be used \nto detect the clouds. SST is computed only over clear oceanic regions. \n \n5.4.1.1.5 Error analysis \nThe uncertainty in the INSAT-3D SST retrieval is straightforward to calculate. Taking \nequation (1) and performing an error analysis, one sees that the error in SST can be \nrepresented \nas: \n \nwhere et is the total error, ai are the estimation coefficients, and ei is the error apparent \nfor each band i used in the algorithm. ei is given by \n \nwith eia being the error due to atmospheric correction and NETi deriving from instrumental \ndesign and performance considerations. Since the constants ai are order 1, and one assumes \nthat the nadir and/or atmospheric errors are comparable and the various bands have similar \ncharacteristics, one can see the error scales as \n          \n \nwhere n is the number of bands used. \nThis analysis makes clear the fact that calibration and/or atmosphere correction errors are \nimportant components of the error budget, i.e., 0.1K of error in calibration for a band is \neffectively an rms error in a dual band algorithm of 0.14K, assuming perfect atmospheric \ncorrection. Therefore, we have requested that the calibration be demonstrably accurate at \nthe choice of 0.05K level to minimize the effect of calibration errors. The best \natmospheric correction currently available for ATSR suggests that errors due to \natmospheric correction in optimal cases for a nadir viewing instrument are approximately \n0.3K [Mutlow, et al., 1994; Minnett, 1990; Barton, et al., 1993; Minnett, 1995b]. \nIf one assumes that the calibration errors and the atmospheric errors are random and thus \ncan be RSS’d, as in the preceding analysis, one sees that expected errors of 0.35K-0.4K \nin the result are the best that can be expected for two-band configurations. This equation \nalso points out that there is a cost associated with adding more bands to improve \natmospheric correction. In addition to providing information potentially useful for \ncorrecting the effects of the intervening atmosphere, each additional band also introduces \nnoise into the SST retrieval. \n \n \n \n \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n93\n \n5.4.2 Flow-Chart: \n \nINSAT-3D \nThermal  \nband \nData \n \nGrey Value  \nTo \nBrightness  \nTemperature \nConversion \nLookup \nTables \nCloud  \nDetection \nthreshold \nCloud  \nDetection \nSpatial  \ncoherence\nLand/Sea  \ndelineation \nSST \nRetrieval \nSST coefficients \nMap Overlay \nSST \nimage/data \nFlowchart of SST processing software for INSAT-3D \nDay/Night  \nFlag \nSingle/split \nchannel \nLand Sea  \nMask \nCloud  \nMask \nRoutine \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n94\n5.4.3 Operational Implementation \nStep-1.

Validation will be jointly done with IMD. \n \n5.6.1 Data required \nBuoy or ship data for SST validation should consists of following parameter \n SHIP/Buoy ID \n Location of the measurement \n Time of the measurement \n SurfaceWind speed and direction \n Surface Relative humidity  \n SST \n Depth at which measurement is taken \n Instrument accuracy of SST. \n \n5.6.2 Methods of validation \nThe in situ records are first temporally matched-up against the INSAT extractions. To \nlimit variability introduced by the time separation between the two data sources, the \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n96\nabsolute difference between the time of the in situ SST measurement and the time at \nwhich that location is viewed by the INSAT (i.e., the matchup time window) is restricted \nto a maximum of ±30 minutes or ±15 minutes. In situ records that do not fall within the \nstipulated time window will be rejected. The in situ records that pass the temporal \nmatchup subsequently have to pass a spatial test. A maximum distance of 0.1° will be \naccepted between an in situ SST location and the location of the central pixel in the \nINSAT extraction box. \nMeasurement quality control: The climatological SST is then calculated for this box by \nspatial averaging and time interpolation. If the absolute value of the difference between \nthe in situ measurement and the climatology is strictly below 20C the box is included into \nthe database. \n \n5.6.3  \nTechnical issues (limitation etc.) \n \nAccuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the radiative transfer model to \nsimulate the satellite radiances, instrument noise and atmospheric correction. Biases in \nradiative transfer model simulations can be accounted for by validating the derived SST \nwith reliable and concurrent insitu data. In the absence of split thermal window channel \nobservations and a channel sensitive to intervening atmospheric total water vapour \ncontent, the atmospheric correction applied is an indirect. The accuracy of this correction \nwill heavily depend upon the accuracy of the model reanalysis for total water vapour. \nMajor constraints on data quality outside the scope of this effort focus in the following \nareas: accurate pre-launch instrument characterization, instrument NET for each band, \ncalibration model performance, availability of quality controlled surface calibration-\nvalidation observations, availability and access to the various quality assessment data sets, \nand timely access to continuing performance assessment data sets. The on-orbit \ninstrument NET performance is a primary input to the algorithm error budget.  \n \n5.7  Future Scope \nInitially, prelaunch algorithm would be used to derive SST. Over a period of \napproximately one year, after complete calibration and validation of the product, bias \ncorrection and other fine tuning of the coefficients would be carried out. This should \nimprove the accuracy of the product to the desired level. Of course, instrument noise also \nplays a crucial role in determining the overall accuracy of the product. Generation of \nregression coefficients for SST retrieval from simultaneous satellite and buoy \nobservations data base require nearly 250 buoys distributed over Arabian Sea, Bay of \nBengal and Indian Ocean continuously for minimum 2/3 years. \n5.8   References \n1 \nAnding D and R Kauth (1970) “Estimation of sea surface temperature from space”, \nRemote Sensing of Environment, 1, 217-220. \n2 \nBarton I J (1983) Dual channel satellite measurements of sea surface temperature. \nQuarterly journal of Royal Meteorological Society, 109,365-378. \nSea surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n97\n3 \nCoakley J A and F P Bretherton (1982) Cloud cover from high resolution scanner data: \ndetecting and allowing for partially clouded fields of view.

Singh \nSnow Cover Mapping \n \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \nAlgorithms will be developed to map snow cover using INSAT 3D Meteorological payload. \nThe snow mapping algorithm will use a grouped-criteria technique using the Normalized \nDifference Snow Index (NDSI) and other spectral threshold tests to identify snow on a pixel-\nby-pixel basis, and to map snow cover in dense forests. The NDSI is useful for snow \nmapping, as it reflects strongly in the visible region than in the short-wave IR (SWIR) part of \nthe spectrum. In addition, the reflectance of clouds remains high in the short-wave IR, while \nthe reflectance of snow is considerably low.  \nValidation of the INSAT snow maps will be carried out using snow products of AWiFS data \nof Resourcesat1/2 and a limited amount of field measurements. In addition, validation will \nalso be carried out using visual interpretation and the MODIS snow maps. The accuracy of \nthe snow maps will vary with land-cover type. Hence, the Snowmap algorithm has been and \nwill continue to be tested for a variety of land covers. Error estimates have been determined \nfrom field measurements for different land covers, and these errors are used to estimate the \nexpected maximum monthly and annual errors in Himalayan snow mapping using the \nalgorithm. \n6.2 \nIntroduction \n6.2.1 Overview and background \nThe purpose of the snow-mapping algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow cover product \nfrom INSAT 3D data. This algorithm is based on the ratio techniques, which was used \nsuccessfully to monitor snow using AWiFS data of Resourcesat-1. Daily snow and 10 days \nsnow covered digital map products will be generated.  \nSnow covers almost 40 per cent of the Earth's land surface during Northern Hemisphere \nwinter. This makes snow albedo and area an important component of the Earth's radiation \nbalance (Foster and Chang, 1993).  Large areas in the Himalayas are also covered by snow \nduring wintertime. Area of snow can change significantly during winter and spring. This can \naffect stream flow during spring and summer of the rivers originating in the Higher \nHimalayas. In addition, snow pack ablation is highly sensitive to climatic variation. Increase \nin atmospheric temperature can influence snowmelt and stream runoff pattern (Kulkarni, et \nSnow cover \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n102\nal. 2002a). Therefore, mapping of areal extent and reflectance of snow is an important \nparameter for various climatological and hydrological applications. In addition, extent of \nsnow cover can also be used as an input for avalanche investigation. \nSnow was first observed in April 1960 by TIROS-1 satellite in eastern Canada. Since then, \nthe potential for operational satellite-based mapping has been enhanced by the development \nof higher temporal-frequency and satellite sensors with higher spatial resolution. In addition, \nsatellite sensors with better radiometric resolutions, such as MODIS and AWiFS have been \nused successfully for snow mapping (Hall et al. 2002; Kulkarni et. al. 2006). This is possibly \ndue to distinct spectral reflectance characteristics of snow in visible and short wave infrared \nregion. Information generated from satellite observations has been extensively used for \nsnowmelt runoff modeling (Kulkarni et al. 2002b). Remote sensing technique has been \nextensively used for snow cover monitoring in the Himalayan region with the help of \nnumerous satellite sensors (Kulkarni and Rathore. 2003). Various analysis techniques as \nvisual, hybrid (Visual and supervised classification) have been used to estimate areal extent \nof snow cover (Kulkarni and Rathore, 2003). However, major difficulty in snow cover \nmonitoring using automated technique in the Himalayan region is mountain shadow and \nconfusing signature of snow and cloud in the visible and near infrared region. Because of \nabove-mentioned reasons, combination of digital and visual interpretation technique is \nneeded to monitor snow cover. This makes snow cover mapping cumbersome and time \nconsuming. To over come this problem normalized difference snow index method is \ndeveloped and discussed in this paper. In optical region snow reflectance is higher as \ncompared to other land features as grass, rock and water. However, in SWIR region snow \nreflectance is lower than rock and vegetation (Kulkarni et. al. 2002c). Therefore, snow on \nsatellite images appears white in visible and black in SWIR region.  This characteristic has \nbeen effectively used to develop Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) for snow cover \nmapping (Hall et al. 1995).  \n6.2.1.1  \nRemote Sensing of Snow Cover \nOne of the earliest method was used for snow cover monitoring was visual interpretation. \nDuring this investigation Large Format Optical Enlarger was used and investigation was \ncarried out using band 2 of Landsat MSS and IRS LISS-I sensor. The investigation was \nextensively used for snow cover monitoring in Malan, Tosh and many small basins in the \nHimalayas (Kulkarni, et. al. 2004).  \nThis technique was further modified with advancement of Digital Analysis Technique and \navailability of higher frequency satellite data such as WiFS of IRS and VHRR of NOAA \nsatellite. In this technique, a combination of visual and digital analysis was used. This was \nnecessary because mountain shadows in the months from November to February normally \nmake it difficult to use only digital technique for snow cover delineation. From the month of \nMarch mountain shadows are negligible and snow extent can be estimated from supervised \nclassification technique. This technique has been extensively used to map snow cover in \nWestern Himalaya, Baspa and Satluj basins (Kulkarni and Rathore, 2003).  \nAnother major difficulty in snow cover monitoring is cloud cover. It is further compounded \ndue to similar reflectance characteristics of snow and cloud. The discrimination between \nsnow and cloud can be done by using various techniques such as textural analysis, \nassociation with shadow and by using multi temporal analysis. In Himalayas and in present \nSnow cover \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n103\ninvestigation, snow/cloud discrimination was done by using texture, where snow shows \ncharacteristic mountainous pattern, which can not be seen when area is cloud covered.  In \nvisible and near infrared region reflectance of snow and cloud is very high. Therefore \ndiscrimination between snow and cloud is not possible. This is because of similar reflectance \ncharacteristics in this region. In spectral range between 1.55-1.75 m, 2.1-2.35 m and 3.55-\n3.93 m have shown potential for snow/cloud discrimination. In these bands snow shows \nlower reflectance than cloud. Spectral region between 1.55-1.75 m has been successfully \nused to separate certain types of clouds from snow (Kulkarni et. al., 2006). \nReflectance of fresh snow is very high in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, but \ndecreases in the near-IR especially as grain size increases (O'Brien and Munis, 1975; Warren \nand Wiscombe, 1980; Srinivasulu et. al. 2002). In addition, soot from industrial pollution \nbecomes incorporated into the snowpack and this may decrease albedo and enhance \nsnowmelt (Clarke and Noone, 1985; Negi, et. al. 2006). Both because of natural aging and \nother factors (e.g. soot or volcanic ash deposition), the reflectance of snow decreases over \ntime. Fresh snow can have a reflectance (integrated over the reflective part of the spectrum) \nup to about 80 percent but its reflectance may decrease to below 40 percent after snow \ncrystals metamorphose.  \nSnow, like all natural surfaces, is an anisotropic reflector (Nolin and Liang, 2000). The \nreflectance from snow is high in the forward direction and is largely specular. While freshly \nfallen snow can be nearly a Lambertian reflecting surface, as snow metamorphoses the \nspecular component characteristic of forward scattering increases. \n6.2.2 \nObjective \nThe purpose of the snow-mapping algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow cover product \nfrom INSAT 3D data. This algorithm is based on Normalised Difference Snow Index \nmethod, which was used successfully to monitor snow using AWiFS data of Resourcesat. \nDaily snow and maximum 10-day snow covered area digital-map products will be generated.  \nThis algorithm will be further modified, in conjunction with NDVI and infrared brightness \ntemperature to identify snow in forest covers and identify cloud pixels, respectively \n(Romanov et al, 2003).  \n6.3 \nInputs and output data \n6.3.1 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) \n Parameter \nResolution \nQuantization \nAccuracy \nSource \nRadiometric and \ngeometric corrected \ngray count values \nVisible (0.52-0.75 m) \n& SWIR (1.55-1.70 \nm) \npixel \n10 bit \n-- \nDerived from \nraw data by \nDP (data \nprocessing) \nSnow cover \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n104\nRadiometric and \ngeometric corrected \ngray count values of \nTIR-1 channel (10.2-\n11.2 m) \npixel \n10 bit \n- \nDerived from \nraw data by \nDP \nGray value to \nbrightness temperature \nconversion table \n- \n- \n0.3 K \nDerived by \nDP \nGeolocation file \nPixel \n- \n1 pixel \nDerived by \nDP \n \n6.3.2 Other Auxillary data and Model Inputs \nSource \nProduct \nFrequency \nRole in \nalgorithm \nPurpose \nAWiFS \nLand cover map \nEach \nproduct \nModify NDSI \nvalue \nImprove accuracy  \nReflectance \nlibrary \nReflectance in \nvisible and \nSWIR region \nAs per \nrequirement \nNDSI threshold \nvalue before \nlaunch \nDevelopment and \nvalidation of \nalgorithm \nAWiFS/INSAT3A Water mask \nEach \nproduct \nRemove water \nbodies \nImprove accuracy \n6.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications \n6.4.1 Overview \nA grouped-criteria technique incorporating NDSI and threshold-based criterion for the \nalgorithm was selected for the following reasons:  \n1) Similar algorithm is developed for AWiFS sensor of Resourcesat-1. Its accuracy has \nbeen tested over a variety of surface covers relative to snow cover maps prepared \nfrom other techniques. Similar algorithm is also being used to generate snow maps of \nMODIS data.  \n2) The technique can map snow under mountain shadow and independent of local solar \nillumination angle. It makes this algorithm highly suitable for mountainous terrain as \nHimalayas (Kulkarni et. al. 2006). \n3) INSAT 3D Met payloads have a channel between 1.55 to 1.75 m with 1 km spatial \nresolution. Similar channel is not available on GOES satellite. In addition, channel \nnumber 1 and 2 are having 1 km spatial resolution. Therefore, product can be \ngenerated at 1 km resolution.  \n4) The algorithm will be further improved using NDVI and brightness temperature to \nidentify snow under forest and cloud, respectively. In addition, Spectral range of band \n1 of INSAT 3 D and AWiFS band 2 are different, threshold values needs to be \nSnow cover \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n105\nevaluated. This will be initially established using Spectral Reflectance library of \nSpace Applications Centre and then sensitivity analysis of INSAT-3D data. \n5) It runs automatically, without human intervention. It is straightforward, \ncomputationally frugal, and thus easy for the user to understand exactly how the \nproduct is generated.  \nSnow has strong visible reflectance and strong short-wave IR absorbing characteristics. The \nNormalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) is an effective way to distinguish snow from \nmany other surface features. Both sunlit and some shadowed snow is mapped effectively. A \nsimilar index for vegetation, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been \nproven to be effective for monitoring global vegetation conditions throughout the year \n(Tucker, 1979 and 1986). Additionally, some snow/cloud discrimination is accomplished \nusing the NDSI.  \nOther promising techniques, such as traditional supervised multispectral classifications, \nspectral-mixture modeling, or neural-network analyses have not yet been shown to be \nusable for automatic application at the mountainous region. They are also computationally \nintensive. Training or the interaction of an interpreter is required for successful application \nof techniques such as neural-network analysis. These techniques may progress to regional \napplications and possibly even global application in future years.  \n6.4.1.1 Theoretical Background \n6.4.1.1.1 Snow cover map \nThe snow-cover mapping algorithm will be designed to identify snow in each 1 km pixel. A \nregional, daily snow product will be produced. A 10-day composite snow cover product will \nbe generated by compositing successive days of snow cover products. This will yield \nmaximum snow extent for the 10 day period. If a pixel were snow covered on any orbit \nduring that period, then that pixel will be mapped as snow covered even if it were snow-free \non all of the other orbits during the 10-day period. Other coverage and persistence statistics \nwill also be included to assist analysis of the data product.  \nThere has been much discussion concerning the optimum composite period for the snow \nmaps (Kulkarni et. al, 2006). While weekly composites would correspond with the \nNOAA/NESDIS maps and the NOHRSC maps, some modelers are interested in longer \ncomposition periods, e.g., 7 days to one month. 8-day composites were chosen because this \nperiod optimizes the ground coverage from the MODIS instrument. In India, the hydrological \ndata analysis is carried out on 10-daily basis; therefore 10-day composite will be prepared.  If \na researcher wants to produce a composite product for any period other than a 10-day period, \nfrom our daily product, this can be done using the daily data.  \n6.4.1.1.2  \nNormalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) \nThe NDSI is useful for the identification of snow and for separating snow and most cumulus \nclouds. The NDSI is a measure of the relative magnitude of the characteristic reflectance \ndifference between the visible and short-wave IR reflectance of snow. The NDSI is \ninsensitive to a wide range of illumination conditions (Kulkarni et al., 2006). The NDSI is \nanalogous to the normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) (Tucker, 1979 and 1986; \nTownshend and Tucker, 1984). NDSI can be computed as given below; \nSnow cover \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n106\n  \nNDSI = (VisibleINSAT B1 - SWIRINSAT B2) / (VisibleINSAT B1 + SWIRINSAT B2)  \nPixels that are approximately 75% or greater covered by snow were found to have NDSI \nvalues more than 0.4 in our field investigation at Dhundi test site in Himachal Pradesh (Negi \net. al., 2006). These NDSI thresholds have been verified from detailed analysis of numerous \nAWiFS scenes, comparisons with supervised-classification techniques and NDSI technique. \n(Kulkarni et. al, 2004). Pure snow has a high NDSI but NDSI decreases as other features are \nmixed in a pixel. Snow in mixed pixels has an NDSI that is less than that for pure snow. Pure \nsnow can be distinguished by its high NDSI value (Negi et. al., 2006).  Since Bandwidth of \nAWiFS band 1 and INSAT 3D imager is different, initially NDSI threshold value will be \nestablished using Field Spectral Data Library of Space Applications Centre (Singh, et. al., \n2005 and Negi, et. al., 2006). This will be further evaluated during post launch period, by \ncarrying out sensitivity analysis (Kulkarni et. al. 2006).  \nIn forested locations, many snow covered pixels have an NDSI lower than 0.4. To correctly \nclassify these forests as snow covered, a lower NDSI threshold is necessary (Negi et. al., \n2006). NDVI and NDSI will be used together in order to discriminate between snow-free and \nsnow covered forests. Forested pixels have higher NDVI values compared with non-forested \npixels. Thus by using the NDSI and NDVI in combination, it is possible to lower the NDSI \nthreshold in forested areas without compromising the algorithm performance for other land \ncovers. Since appropriate bands are not available in INSAT 3D payload, mask will be \ngenerated using AWiFS sensor. \nThe NDSI-NDVI field is designed to capture as much of the variation in NDSI-NDVI values \nobserved in the snow covered forests as possible while minimizing inclusion of non-forested \npixels. It was designed to include forest-covered pixels that have NDSI values lower than 0.4, \nyet have NDVI values lower than would be expected for snow-free conditions (Klein et al., \n1998).  \nSince water may also have an NDSI 0.4, therefore permanent mask is necessary to separate \nwater from snow. \n6.4.1.1.3  \nSnow / Cloud Discrimination \nSnow/cloud-discrimination techniques are based on differences between cloud and snow \nreflectance and emittance characteristics. Clouds are highly variable and may be detected by \ntheir generally high reflectance in the visible and near-IR parts of the electromagnetic \nspectrum (Kulkarni et al, 2002), whereas the reflectance of snow drops in the short-wave \ninfrared part of the spectrum.  \nWhile the NDSI can separate snow from most obscuring clouds, it does not always identify \nor discriminate optically-thin cirrus clouds from snow. Analyses of AWiFS and MODIS data \nshow that NDSI can map snow under cirrus clouds at least some of the time. Cirrus clouds \nhave high reflectance in SWIR region than snow which requires fine tuning of threshold \nvalue and will be used as an additional criterion in present approach. This algorithm will \nfurther be improved due to availability of thermal bands in INSAT 3D Met payload. \nAppropriate brightness temperature threshold will be used to separate cloud from snow \n(Romanov, et. al., 2003) or cloud removal will also be tested using cloud mask product \nsubject to its availability as an additional INSAT 3D derived product. This will be additional \ncriteria than in build criteria of NDSI.  \nSnow cover \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n107\n6.4.1.1.4 Flow Chart \n \n \nSnow cover \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n108\n6.4.1.1.5  \nSensitivity analysis to establish NDSI threshold \nIn order to establish credible threshold value of NDSI for snow cover mapping, a sensitivity \ntest of individual threshold values were carried out. NDSI threshold values were changed \nfrom 0 to 1 at an interval of 0.05.  If pixel is having NDSI value equal or more than threshold \nvalue then it is classified as snow. Then loss in areal extent due to increase in threshold value \nare converted into percent and plotted on Y-axis . X-axis indicate NDSI threshold. In general, \nareal extent decreases as NDSI value increases from 0 to 1. But amount of change varies \nfrom constant to rapid. In case of AWiFS scene of winter, constant drop in area in the order \nof 3% was observed as threshold value changes from 0 to 0.4. After threshold of 0.4 drop in \narea (Snow pixels) is moderate to rapid.  Visual analysis suggests that all snow cover areas \nincluding snow in forest and mountain shadow can be mapped if threshold value is 0.4. In \norder to establish validity of this observation, the similar investigations were carried out from \nDecember to May at an interval of one month. The NDSI threshold will be fine tuned after \nthe availability of INSAT 3D derived snow cover product.  \n6.4.2        Operational Implementation \n6.4.1.2 Step 1 : Conversion from gray count to Reflectance and BT: \nIn this step, the DN values will be converted into Radiance, Reflectance and \nBrightness temperature using calibration coefficient available with INSAT 3D \ndata.

In addition, comparisons will be made between MODIS maps. Comparison of \nSnowmap results with these independently-produced snow data sets will allow errors to be \nidentified that will permit us to determine the accuracy of the global maps relative to one \nanother. There are several hemispheric-scale satellite-derived snow-cover maps available, but \nnone has been fully validated.  \n6.6.1.2. Mapping Snow in Densely-Forested Areas \nA significant limitation in mapping the extent of snow cover occurs in situations of mixed \npixels where snow cover is obscured by dense forest cover. The snow covered forested \nlandscape is actually never completely snow covered because the tree branches, trunks and \ncanopies often do not get or stay snow covered. Often, in boreal forests, snow that falls on \nthe coniferous tree canopy will not stay on the canopy for the entire winter due to \nsublimation. Thus, even in a continuously snow covered area, much of the forested landscape \nwill not be snow covered. It may be very difficult, even with field measurements and high-\nresolution air photos, to determine what percentage of the area is snow covered. Additionally, \nwhen viewing at off-nadir angles the tree branches, canopies, etc., will obscure even more of \nthe snow than when viewing at near-nadir angles.  \nDense forests cover much of the Earth’s land surface. Snow accumulates to greater depths \nand melts later in the spring in the boreal forests than in adjacent areas (Foster et al., 1991). \nThough the boreal forests are always snow covered in the winter, within dense forests, snow \nthat falls onto the ground through the canopy may not be visible from above. Some snow \nstays in the tree canopy and may thus be visible, but the snow often does not stay in the \ncanopy during the entire winter. Snow in trees often sublimates before falling to the ground. \nTherefore, NDSI values will be appropriately modified to identify snow under forest cover. \n6.6.2 Estimate of Errors in Snow cover Mapping  \nIt is recognized that NDSI will perform better in some land covers than in others. Specifically, \nresults using the NDSI algorithm with AWiFS data above snow line show 100 percent snow \ncover when they were known by field measurements to be 100 percent snow covered. In \nforested areas, errors may be much larger.  \nAn estimate of the errors inherent in using Snow cover map in different land covers will be \nmade using data from focused field missions, for example: agricultural (e.g. in the Kullu \ndistrict.), forest free (e.g. Lahaul and Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh), forest (e.g. Forested \nregion of Beas basin), Errors have been determined for the following land covers: forests, \nmixed agriculture and forest, barren/sparsely-vegetated, shrub land, wetlands, and glacial \nregion. These land covers were selected because they cover a wide range of conditions \nencountered in snow covered parts of the Himalaya.   \n \n \nSnow cover \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n110\n6.7 Future Scope \nThis algorithm will be further modified, in conjunction with NDVI and infrared brightness \ntemperature to identify snow in forest covers and identify cloud pixels, respectively. \n6.8 References \n \n1) Clarke, A.D. and K.J.

Since \nHimalayan region is highly mountainous, the data processing would initially need calibration, \ngeoreferencing, atmospheric correction, snow pixel detection, cloud masking, local \nillumination angle correction, diffuse radiation correction, BDRF correction and \northorectification.  This will be followed by Linear or non-linear mixing modeling to \nestimate snow fraction in each pixel. The mixing modeling would need large spectral \nreflectance library of snow and other land features of Himalayan region, to identify end \nmembers of snow and snow free terrain. \nNext important step in the investigation is to develop a relationship between snow fraction \nand depth. This would need field snow depth data. In North America this relationship was \ndeveloped using 1400 field observatories. Relationship was found useful; if snow depth is \nless than 27 cm. Field data needs to be collected from Indian Meteorological Department. \n7.2 Introduction \n7.2.1 Overview and background \nThe purpose of the snow-depth estimation algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow depth \nproduct from INSAT 3D data. The algorithm based on correlation between depth of the snow \npack and satellite derived sub pixel fractional snow cover (Romanov and Tarpley, 2004). \nHowever, this relationship was developed for non-forested, open prairie (plain terrain) region \nof North America. The accuracy of snow depth retrievals was found 30% of observed snow \ndepth for snow depth below 30 cm. The satellite derived sub pixel fractional snow cover is \nindependent of snow depth, if snow depth is more than 30 cm (Romanov and Tarpley, 2004). \nSnow covers almost 40 per cent of the Earth's land surface during Northern Hemisphere \nwinter. This makes snow albedo and area an important component of the Earth's radiation \nbalance (Foster and Chang, 1993).  Large areas in the Himalayas are also covered by snow \nSnow depth \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n116\nduring wintertime. Area of snow can change significantly during winter and spring. This can \naffect stream flow during spring and summer of the rivers originating in the Higher \nHimalayas. In order to make optimum utilization of snow information for hydrological, \nclimatological and disaster purpose, snow depth is an important parameter. In addition, snow \npack ablation is highly sensitive to climatic variation. Increase in atmospheric temperature \ncan influence snowmelt and stream runoff pattern (Kulkarni, et al. 2002a). \nTherefore, mapping of areal extent and reflectance of snow is an important parameter for \nvarious climatological and hydrological applications. In addition, extent of snow cover can \nalso be used as an input for avalanche investigation. \nSnow was first observed by satellite in eastern Canada from the TIROS-1 satellite in April \n1960. Since then, the potential for operational satellite-based mapping has been enhanced by \nthe development of higher temporal-frequency and satellite sensors with higher spatial \nresolution. In addition, satellite sensors with better radiometric resolutions, such as MODIS \nand AWiFS have been used successfully for snow mapping (Hall et al. 2002; Kulkarni et. al. \n2006). This is possibly due to distinct spectral reflectance characteristics of snow in visible \nand short wave infrared region. Information generated from satellite observations has been \nextensively used for snowmelt runoff modeling (Kulkarni et al. 2002b). Remote sensing \ntechnique has been extensively used for snow cover monitoring in the Himalayan region with \nthe help of numerous satellite sensors (Kulkarni and Rathore. 2003). Various analysis \ntechniques as visual, hybrid (Visual and supervised classification) have been used to estimate \nareal extent of snow cover (Kulkarni and Rathore, 2003). However, major difficulty in snow \ncover monitoring using automated technique in the Himalayan region is mountain shadow \nand confusing signature of snow and cloud in the visible and near infrared region. Because of \nabove-mentioned reasons, combination of digital and visual interpretation technique is \nneeded to monitor snow cover. This makes snow cover mapping cumbersome and time \nconsuming. To over come this problem normalized difference snow index method is \ndeveloped and discussed in this paper. In optical region snow reflectance is higher as \ncompared to other land features as grass, rock and water. However, in SWIR region snow \nreflectance is lower than rock and vegetation (Kulkarni et. al. 2002c). Therefore, snow on \nsatellite images appears white in visible and black in SWIR region.  This characteristic can \nbe effectively used to develop Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) for snow cover \nmapping (Hall et al. 1995). \n7.2.1.1 Remote Sensing of Snow Cover and Depth  \nOne of the earliest method was used for snow cover monitoring was visual interpretation. \nDuring this investigation Large Format Optical Enlarger was used and investigation was \ncarried out using band 2 of Landsat MSS and IRS LISS-I sensor. The investigation was \nextensively used for snow cover monitoring in Malan, Tosh and many small basins in the \nHimalayas (Kulkarni, et. al. 2004).  \nThis technique was further modified with advancement of Digital Analysis Technique and \navailability of higher frequency satellite data such as WiFS of IRS and VHRR of NOAA \nsatellite. In this technique combination of visual and digital analysis technique was used. \nThis was necessary because mountain shadows in the months from November to February \nnormally make it difficult to used only digital technique for snow cover delineation. From the \nmonth of March mountain shadows are negligible and snow extent can be estimated from \nSnow depth \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n117\nsupervised classification technique. This technique has been extensively used to map snow \ncover in Western Himalaya, Baspa and Satluj basins (Kulkarni and Rathore, 2003).  \nAnother important difficulty in snow cover monitoring is cloud cover. It is \nfurther compounded due to similar reflectance characteristics of snow and cloud. The \ndiscrimination between snow and cloud can be done by using various techniques such as \ntextural analysis, association with shadow and by using multi temporal analysis. In \nHimalayas and in present investigation, snow/cloud discrimination was done by using texture, \nwhere snow shows characteristic mountainous pattern and it can not be seen, when area is \ncovered by cloud cover.  In visible and near infrared region reflectance of snow and cloud is \nvery high. Therefore discrimination between snow and cloud is not possible. This is because \nof similar reflectance characteristics in this region. In spectral range between 1.55-1.75 m, \n2.1-2.35 m and 3.55-3.93 m have shown potential for snow/cloud discrimination. In \nthese bands snow shows lower reflectance than cloud. Spectral region between 1.55-1.75 m \nhas been successfully used to separate some types of clouds from snow (Kulkarni et. al., \n2006). \n7.2.1.2 Estimation of Snow Reflectance in Himalaya \nIn order to estimate snow fraction important step is estimation of reflectance. Reflectance of \nfresh snow is very high in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, but decreases in \nthe near-IR especially as grain size increases (O'Brien and Munis, 1975; Warren and \nWiscombe, 1980; Srinivasulu et. al. 2002). In addition, soot from industrial pollution \nbecomes incorporated into the snowpack and this may decrease albedo and enhance \nsnowmelt (Clarke and Noone, 1985; Negi, et. al. 2006). Both because of natural aging and \nother factors (e.g. soot or volcanic ash deposition), the reflectance of snow decreases over \ntime. Fresh snow can have a reflectance (integrated over the reflective part of the spectrum) \nup to about 80 percent but its reflectance may decrease to below 40 percent after snow \ncrystals metamorphose.  \nOne of the parameter, which can influence satellite obtained reflectance is terrain topography. \nThe relative magnitudes of terrain slope and its aspect with respect to the sun's position will \ndetermine the amount of direct solar radiation incident on an undulating surface. The analysis \ncarried out over the Beas Basin, Himachal Pradesh, India, indicated a variation of 22% in the \namount of incident solar radiation for an increase of 10 in terrain slope (Srinivasulu and \nKulkarni, 2003).  \nVarious parameters required to estimate reflectance are mean solar exo-atmospheric spectral \nirradiances in the sensor bands, digital elevation information, solar declination, mean earth-\nsun distance on a Julian day, and the calibration parameters of the sensor, such as maximum \nand minimum radiances in the sensor bands. The terrain topography parameters, viz., terrain \nslope and aspect are derived from the digital elevation information of the terrain. The local \nillumination angle for each pixel, which determines the amount of direct solar radiation \nincident on a sloped surface, is computed using both the sun and terrain geometry. \nMarkham and Barker equation for computing reflectance from a flat area cannot be valid for \nthe Himalayan region where the terrain is highly undulating.  To estimate reflectance from a \nrugged terrain, cosine of the local illumination angle, not the cosine of solar zenith angle, has \nto be used as given below: \nSnow depth \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n118\n \n \n     \n=           L d2   /   Esun  cosi  \nWhere, d is the mean earth-sun distance on a Julian day (AU), and i is the local illumination \nangle (degree), the angle between the Sun's rays and the surface normal and is calculated by \nusing the relation given by Robinson (1966). \nSnow, like all natural surfaces, is an anisotropic reflector (Salomonson and Marlatt, 1968; \nDirmhirn and Eaton, 1975; Steffen, 1987; Nolin and Liang, 2000). The reflectance from \nsnow is greatest in the forward direction and is largely specular. While freshly fallen snow \ncan be nearly a Lambertian reflecting surface, as snow metamorphoses the specular \ncomponent characteristic of forward scattering increases. This means, reflectance of snow \nwill change depending upon view and illumination geometry. This can be described by \nBidirectional reflectance distribution Function (BRDF) (George Joseph, 2005).  \n7.2.2 \nObjective \nThe purpose of the snow-depth estimation algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow depth \nproduct from INSAT 3D data. The algorithm based on correlation between depth of the snow \npack and satellite derived sub pixel fractional snow cover (Romanov and Tarpley, 2004).  \nHowever, this relationship was developed for non-forested, open prairie (plain terrain) region \nof North America. Therefore, this algorithm needs further development for application in \nmountainous Himalayan Terrain. This involves reflectance correction using local \nillumination angle, diffuse radiation from sidewalls and Bidirectional reflectance distribution \nFunction (BRDF). BRDF is necessary as snow reflectance in anisotropic with aging. \n7.3  Inputs \n7.3.1 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) \n \nParameter \nResolution \nQuantization \nAccuracy \nSource \nRadiometric and \ngeometric \ncorrected gray \ncount values \nVisible (0.52-0.75 \nm) & SWIR \n(1.55-1.70 m) \npixel \n10 bit \n-- \nDerived from \nraw data by \nDP (data \nprocessing) \nRadiometric and \ngeometric \ncorrected gray \ncount values of \nTIR-1 channel \n(10.2-11.2 m) \npixel \n10 bit \n- \nDerived from \nraw data by \nDP \nGray value to \nbrightness \ntemperature \nconversion table \n- \n- \n0.3 K \nDerived by \nDP \nGeolocation file \nPixel \n- \n1 pixel \nDerived by \nDP \nSnow depth \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n119\n7.3.2 \nOther Auxillary data and Model Inputs \n \nSource \nProduct \nRole in algorithm \nPurpose \nField Data \nSnow Depth \nDevelopment of \nSnow fraction and \nsnow depth based \napproach \nDeveloping and \nvalidating. \nSensor parameter \nSun-solar geometry \nDeriving snow \nfraction map \nGeneration of snow \ncover map \nTopographic map \nDigital Elevation \nModel \nTerrain parameters \nComputation of \nSlope and aspect of \nterrain. \nAOD, O3, and \nother gases \nTransmittance \ncoefficient \nAtmospheric \ncorrection \nTo minimize \natmospheric \ncontribution \nAWiFS \nLand cover map \nModify NDSI value \nImprove accuracy  \nReflectance library \nReflectance in \nvisible and SWIR \nregion \nNDSI threshold \nvalue before launce \nDevelopment and \nvalidation of \nalgorithm \nAWiFS \nWater mask \nRemove water \nbodies \nImprove accuracy \n \n7.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications \n7.4.1 Overview \nFirst step in this study is estimation of snow pixels. A grouped-criteria technique \nincorporating a NDSI and threshold-based criterion for the algorithm will be used due to the \nfollowing reasons:  \n1) Similar algorithm is developed for AWiFS sensor of Resourcesat. Its accuracy has \nbeen tested over a variety of surface covers relative to snow cover maps prepared \nfrom other techniques. Similar algorithm is also being used to generate snow maps \nusing MODIS data.  \n2) The technique can map snow under mountain shadow and independent of local solar \nillumination angle. It makes this algorithm highly suitable for mountainous terrain as \nHimalayas. \n3) INSAT 3D Met payloads have a channel between 1.55 to 1.75 m with 1 km spatial \nresolution. Similar channel is not available on GOES satellite. In addition, channel \nnumber 1 and 2 are having 1 km spatial resolution. Therefore, product can be \ngenerated at 1 km resolution.  \n4) It runs automatically, without human intervention. It is straightforward, \ncomputationally frugal, and thus easy for the user to understand exactly how the \nproduct is generated.  \nSnow has strong visible reflectance and strong short-wave IR absorbing characteristics. The \nNormalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) is an effective way to distinguish snow from \nSnow depth \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n120\nmany other surface features. Both sunlit and some shadowed snow is mapped effectively. A \nsimilar index for vegetation, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been \nproven to be effective for monitoring global vegetation conditions throughout the year \n(Tucker, 1979 and 1986). Additionally, some snow/cloud discrimination is accomplished \nusing the NDSI.  \nOther promising techniques, such as traditional supervised multispectral classifications, \nspectral-mixture modeling, or neural-network analyses have not yet been shown to be usable \nfor automatic application at the global scale. They are also computationally intensive. \nTraining or the interaction of an interpreter is required for successful application of \ntechniques such as neural-network analysis. These techniques may progress to regional \napplications and possibly even global application in future years.  \n7.4.1.1 Theoretical Background \n7.4.1.1.1 Identification of Snow pixels \nThe snow-cover mapping algorithm will be designed to identify snow in each 1 km pixel. A \nregional, daily snow product will be produced. An 10-day composited snow cover product \nwill be generated by compositing successive days of snow cover products. This will yield \nmaximum snow extent for the 10 day period. If a pixel were snow covered on any orbit \nduring that period, then that pixel will be mapped as snow covered even if it were snow-free \non all of the other orbits during the 10-day period. Other coverage and persistence statistics \nwill also be included to assist analysis of the data product.  \nThere has been much discussion concerning the optimum composite period for the snow \nmaps (Kulkarni et. al, 2006). While weekly composites would correspond with the \nNOAA/NESDIS maps and the NOHRSC maps, some modelers are interested in longer \ncomposition periods, e.g., 7 days to one month. 8-day composites were chosen because this \nperiod optimizes the ground coverage from the MODIS instrument. The repeat period of the \nsatellite is 16 days. In India, the hydrological data analysis is carried out on 10-daily basis; \ntherefore 10-day composite will be prepared.  If a researcher wants to produce a composite \nproduct for any period other than a 10-day period, from our daily product, this can be done \nusing the daily data.  \n7.4.1.1.2 Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) \nThe NDSI is useful for the identification of snow and for separating snow and most cumulus \nclouds. The NDSI is a measure of the relative magnitude of the characteristic reflectance \ndifference between the visible and short-wave IR reflectance of snow. The NDSI is \ninsensitive to a wide range of illumination conditions, is partially normalized for atmospheric \neffects, and does not depend on reflectance in a single band (Kulkarni 2006). The NDSI is \nanalogous to the normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) (Tucker, 1979 and 1986; \nTownshend and Tucker, 1984).  \n NDSI = (INSAT Band 1 - INSAT Band 2) / (INSAT Band 1 + INSAT Band 2)  \nPixels that are approximately 25 % or greater covered by snow have been found to have \nNDSI values 0.4 in our field investigation at Dhundi test site in Himachal Pradesh (Negi et. \nal., 2006). Since water may also have an NDSI 0.4, therefore permanent mask is necessary to \nseparate water from snow. \nSnow depth \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n121\nThese NDSI thresholds have been verified from detailed analysis of numerous AWiFS scenes, \ncomparisons with supervised-classification techniques and NDSI technique. (Kulkarni et. al.  \n2004).  Pure snow has a high NDSI but NDSI decreases as other features are mixed in a pixel. \nSnow in mixed pixels has an NDSI that is less than that for pure snow. Pure snow can be \ndistinguished by its high NDSI value (Negi et. al., 2006).  \nIn forested locations, many snow covered pixels have an NDSI lower than 0.4. To correctly \nclassify these forests as snow covered, a lower NDSI threshold is necessary (negi et. al., \n2006; Hall et al, 1998). The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the NDSI \nare used together in order to discriminate between snow-free and snow covered forests. \nForested pixels have higher NDVI values compared with non-forested pixels. Thus by using \nthe NDSI and NDVI in combination, it is possible to lower the NDSI threshold in forested \nareas without compromising the algorithm performance in other land covers. Since \nappropriate bands are not available in INSAT 3D payload, mask will be generated using \nAWiFS sensor. \nThe NDSI-NDVI field is designed to capture as much of the variation in NDSI-NDVI values \nobserved in the snow covered forests as possible while minimizing inclusion of non-forested \npixels. It was designed to include forest-covered pixels that have NDSI values lower than 0.4, \nyet have NDVI values lower than would be expected for snow-free conditions (Klein et al., \n1998).  \n7.4.1.1.3 Snow / Cloud Discrimination \nSnow/cloud-discrimination techniques are based on differences between cloud and snow \nreflectance and emittance characteristics. Clouds are highly variable and may be detected by \ntheir generally-high reflectance in the visible and near-IR parts of the electromagnetic \nspectrum (Kulkarni et al, 2002), whereas the reflectance of snow drops in the short-wave \ninfrared part of the spectrum.  \nWhile the NDSI can separate snow from most obscuring clouds, it does not always identify \nor discriminate optically-thin cirrus clouds from snow. Analyses of AWiFS and MODIS data \nshow that NDSI can map snow under cirrus clouds at least some of the time. This algorithm \nwill be further improves, as INSAT 3D Met payload is having thermal bands. Appropriate \nbrigtness temperature threshold will be used to separate cloud from snow (Romanov, et. al., \n2003). This will be additional criteria than in build criteria of NDSI.  \n7.4.1.1.4 Estimation of Snow Reflectance  \nVarious parameters required to estimate reflectance are mean solar exo-atmospheric spectral \nirradiances in the sensor bands, digital elevation information, solar declination, mean earth-\nsun distance on a Julian day, and the calibration parameters of the sensor, such as maximum \nand minimum radiances in the sensor bands. The terrain topography parameters, viz., terrain \nslope and aspect are derived from the digital elevation information of the terrain. The local \nillumination angle for each pixel, which determines the amount of direct solar radiation \nincident on a sloped surface, is computed using both the sun and terrain geometry. \nMarkham and Barker equation for computing reflectance from a flat area cannot be valid for \nthe Himalayan region where the terrain is highly undulating.  To estimate reflectance from a \nrugged terrain, cosine of the local illumination angle, not the cosine of solar zenith angle, has \nto be used as given below: \nSnow depth \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n122\n \n \n     \n=           L d2   /   Esun  cosi  \nWhere, d is the mean earth-sun distance on a Julian day (AU), and i is the local illumination \nangle (degree), the angle between the Sun's rays and the surface normal and is calculated by \nusing the relation given by Robinson (1966). \nSnow, like all natural surfaces, is an anisotropic reflector (Salomonson and Marlatt, 1968; \nDirmhirn and Eaton, 1975; Steffen, 1987; Nolin and Liang, 2000). The reflectance from \nsnow is greatest in the forward direction and is largely specular. While freshly fallen snow \ncan be nearly a Lambertian reflecting surface, as snow metamorphoses the specular \ncomponent characteristic of forward scattering increases. This means, reflectance of snow \nwill change depending upon view and illumination geometry. This can be described by \nBidirectional reflectance distribution Function (BRDF) (George Joseph, 2005).  \nF(θi, Øi, θr, Ør) = dLr (θi, Øi, θr, Ør)/Li cos θi  dwi \nWhere, \nΘi = Zenith angle of incident ray \nØi = Azimuth angle of incident ray \nΘr = Zenith angle of reflected ray \nØr = Azimuth angle of reflected ray \nLi = Incident radiance \ndLr = Reflected radiance in solid angle \ndwi = Solid angle \n7.4.1.1.5 SNOW FRACTION RETRIEVAL \nTo calculate snow fraction (F), technique similar to a linear mixture technique can be used \n(Romanov and Tarpley, 2004). This techniques need two end members representing the \nvisible reflectance of a completely snow-covered and completely snow-free land surface, \nRsnow and Rland, respectively.  \nF = (R-Rland) / (Rsnow-Rland) \nWhere, R is the observed visible reflectance of the scene. The reflectance of snow free land \nin every grid cell of the map will be established from satellite data obtained during snow free \nseason. The reflectance of snow assumed to be independent of location and determined \nempirically from satellite data or from field reflectance observations. Previous investigations \nhave shown that snow fraction retrievals was unreliable over mountainous area due to \nfrequent specular reflectance effects on satellite observed visible reflectance (Romanov and \nTarpley, 2004). Attempt will be made to resolve this problem by using concepts mentioned \nabove as local illumination angle correction, Bidirectional reflectance distribution Function \nand multiple data analysis in a day.  \n7.4.1.1.6 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SNOW FRACTION AND DEPTH \nRomanov and Tarpley, (2004) have developed a statistical relationship between satellite \nobserved snow fraction and field observed snow depth. For this purpose field snow depth \ndata of 1400 locations in Great Plains of USA and Canadian Prairies were analyzed. During \nmatching observations, to reduce the effect of possible inhomogeneity of the snow depth \ndistribution and inaccuracy of gecoding, snow fraction was averaged 3 x 3 grid. For \ndevelopment of this technique, forested region was exclude. A statistical relationship was \ndeveloped between snow fraction and depth (Romanov and Tarpley, 2004).  \nD = eaF –1 \nSnow depth \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n123\nWhere, D (cm) is the snow depth, F (%) is the snow fraction and a is a parameter. The best \napproximation of snow fraction and snow depth was achieve with a = 0.0333. This means \n100 percent snow fraction can give snow depth around 27 cm. This could be major limitation \nin the Himalaya, as snow depth is normally very high due orographic effect and avalanche \naccumulation of snow.  \nIn order to apply this concept in the Himalaya, daily snow depth data needs to be collected \nfrom IMD and SASE observatories and region specific relationship needs to be developed. \nThis relationship should be developed using historical INSAT, MODIS and snow depth data. \nSnow depth \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n124\n7.4.1.2 Flow Chart \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1.

The radiometrically-\nprocessed data will also be geolocated and this will provide a radiometrically and \ngeometrically corrected product for further analysis. \n \n7.4.2.2 \nStep 2: Cloud elimination \nThis step includes the cloud screening from the INSAT 3D image. Cloud screening is based \non the temperature data and will help to clear cloudy pixels, which possibly are not feasible \nto screen out using visible and SWIR channel based NDSI image. \n \n7.4.2.3 \nStep 3: Topographic and Atmospheric correction \nIn this step, DEM data will be used to compute the terrain parameters like slope and aspect of \nthe terrain, which will further be used to compute the local illumination angle. Atmospheric \ncorrection algorithm will be applied to compute the atmospherically corrected radiance and \nreflectance values with standard procedures. This step will provide us the atmospherically \nand topographically corrected radiances and reflectance. \n \n7.4.2.4 \nStep 4: Snow pixel identification \nSnow pixel identification will be done by using NDSI based approach which uses the \nnormalized ratio of visible and SWIR wavelength reflectance. This prepares a binary map of \neither snow or non-snow pixels. \n \n7.4.2.5 \nSnow fraction retrieval \nFractional snow map will be prepared by using linear mixing approach. This considers land \nand pure snow as end members and compute the snow fraction of any particular pixel using \nreflectance value. \n \n7.4.2.6 \nSnow Depth Estimation \nA statistical relationship was developed between snow fraction and depth (Romanov and \nTarpley, 2004).

Sites, which were used for development of snow depth algorithm, will be \nused during validation, however both the activites will be carried out at different time frame. \n \n7.6.2 Estimate of Errors in Snow Depth Mapping  \nStandard statistical methods will be used to assess error of estimation, as snow depth data is \navailable from field and satellite.  \n \n7.7  Technical issues: \nThe snow depth of this method is limited to 27 cm of snow depth in prairie region which is \nexpected to deteriorate further for highly rugged Himalayan mountain. It is required to \ndevelop the exponential relationship for Himalayan region based on snow depth. \n \n7.8  Future Scope \nIn future scope the developed statistical relationship of snow depth with fractional snow will \nbe modified for Himalayan region as and when data will be available. Indian Meteorological \nDepartment will provide field data of snow depth and snow fraction.  \n \n7.9  References \n1. Clarke, A.D. and K.J.

Forest fire quite \nfrequently occurs during summer seasons in tropical countries. A study by forest survey \nof India has revealed that 51% of the forest area in Assam and Gujarat, 93% in Arunachal \nPradesh, 67% in Bihar, 69% in Himanchal Pradesh, 46 % in Jammu and Kashmir, 45% in \nKarnataka, 76% in Madhya Pradesh, 94% in Meghalaya and Orissa, 87% in Nagaland, \n58% in Uttar Pradesh and 33% in W. Bengal is subject to annual fires.  \nOne of the most important critical elements of the forest fire management system (FFMS) \nin the country is the real time detection onset of fire and it’s monitoring; study the rate, \ndirection and quantitative estimation of fire spread and amount of smoke emission. \nSatellite data with suitable spectral bands for fire detection (Visible, SWIR, MIR and \nThermal IR bands), daily or twice a day’s repetivity (day and night) and bare minimum \nspatial resolution, which can locate the fire, can play an important role in development of \ncountry’s FFMS.  Geostationary satellite such as GOES with automated biomass burning \nalgorithm (ABBA) have matured enough for providing information on large-scale forest \nfires on a regular basis (Prins et al, 1992, 1994, 1998). INSAT-3D imager data with 1 km \nresolution in Visible and SWIR bands and 4 km. in MIR and in TIR-I and TIR-II will \nhelp in detecting and monitoring of large scale forest fires, smoke and burn scar.  \nThe purpose of this document is to present an algorithm for retrieving forest fire areas \nfrom   INSAT-3D multi-wavelength   thermal   radiation measurements in clear skies. \nThe INSAT-3D fire products will be built on the experience of fire assessment using the \nMODIS, NOAA-AVHRR and GOES systems. The fire products will include an \nidentification of the occurrence of thermal anomalies, and an estimate the total emitted \nFire \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n132\nenergy from the fire.  The products will be made available at full resolution (4 km) and as \nspatial summaries and temporal composites.  Daytime and nighttime fire distributions \nproducts will be identified.   \nThe fire products will be developed on the basis of convergence of evidence from \ndifferent spectral information. The INSAT-3D fire products will provide information on \nthe location of a fire, its emitted energy, and an estimate of area burned. The fire products \nwill be made available through IMD as daily 4 km resolution and spatially and \ntemporally summarized products (10 km, and 8 day and monthly), more suited for use by \nthe broader environmental management community as well as modelling community. \n8.2.2 Objective \nThe basic purpose of this document is to propose an algorithm for identifying fire using \nINSAT 3D imager data.

In order to detect \nthe presence of fire in a non-interactive fashion, a set of detection multiband thresholding \ncriteria different for the day and night fire observations are prescribed. These criteria are \nbased on the apparent temperature of the fire pixel and the difference between the fire \npixel and its background temperature. In this section we describe the theoretical basis and \nalgorithm overview for identification of fire. \n \n8.4.1 Overview \n8.4.1.1 Theoretical Background \n Any object above absolute zero ( 0 K; -273.16o C; -459.69o F) emits EMR. \n As temp. increases the maxima shifts towards shorter wave length. \nFire \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n134\n λmax=2897/T  ; µm (Wien’s displacement law) can give max. W.L. at \nwhich the exitance is maximum & is related to Temp. (e,g, λmax=9.66 µ at \n300o K) \n \nINSAT MIR Channel (3.70 to 3.95µm) is located near the spectral maximum for \nradiative emission for objects radiating at temperature around 400 to 1200 K. this \ntemperature is closed to the temperature of burning forest biomass. INSAT, TIR-I \nChannel (10.20µm – 11.30µm) and TIR-II (11.5µm to 12.5µm) are located near the \nspectral maxima for normal environment temperature i.e. around 300 K (fig.1).  \nTherefore, both these channels will be useful in fire detection algorithms. \n \n \nFigure.1.

Visible and SWIR bands will be utilized for masking clouds and water bodies. \nContextual Algorithm (Giglio, et al., 1999: and Kaufman, et al., 1998) is proposed at this \nstage. \nA fire location represents the approximate location of the fire pixels and do not represent \nthe actual fire size, which is usually much smaller than pixel size (4 km.). The INSAT at \nNadir is 4x4 Km, for MIR and TIR, which is quite large, but the fire phenomenon is \nusually much smaller than that. Studies at Cooperative Institute of Meteorological \nSatellite Studies (CIMSS) at the University of Wisconsin have shown that the sub –\nsatellite point, and smoldering at 450 K, in case of GOES (IFOV: 4x4Km) is \napproximately 0.5 to 1 acre in size in relatively non-cloudy conditions. \nRobinson (1991) has shown that due to very high amplification over background at 3.7 \nµm for forest fires occupying even a small fraction of a percent of an AVHRR pixel can \nsubstantially increase the mid IR brightness of the entire pixel. Therefore, fire (active \nfire) can be monitored at very low spatial resolution. \n8.4.1.2 Algorithm Overview \nThe fire detection algorithm proposed here employs multi-thresholding contextual \ntechnique, which includes multi band thresholds, and compares with the background. The \nalgorithm will first masks out ocean, desert, water and cloud pixels and then proceed \nfurther. The contextual algorithms identify a fire pixel based on the level of contrast \nbetween the potential fire pixel and its “background” pixels (the definition of background \nvaries according to kernel size). As opposed to the fixed threshold techniques, which \nmust be defined for given regions and seasons, the contextual algorithm is supposed to be \nflexible and effective in different environmental conditions. Potential fire pixels will be \nidentified using a less restrictive version of the threshold algorithm. These threshold \nvalues will be determined through visual inspection of known fire/non-fire pixels. An \ninitial threshold reduces the number of candidate pixels to be applied to the contextual \nalgorithm. The contextual algorithm is based on detecting the contrast between a pixel \nand its background. A pixel’s background can be defined as the 15x15 window \nsurrounding the subject pixel. Because of the large areal extent of many interior Indian \nwildfires, it is necessary to have such a large window size to define the background \nvalues. If a background window size is too small (for example, 3x3), there is a good \nchance that large wildfires occupying several pixels will elevate the background values \nrendering the fire undetectable. \nThe algorithm is a three-step process: \nFirst, the temperatures of channels 3, 5, & 6 of INSAT-3D from pixels adjacent to the \ntest pixel will be averaged; these values will be utilized in a separate algorithm to \nestimate background temperature and adjusted temperature values for channels 3 & 5.  \nSecond, a user-defined minimum fire temperature of interest will be specified.  \n \nThird, if the adjusted temperature value for channel 3 is greater than the threshold \nchannel 3 temperature, the pixel is classified as fire.

It is formed by combustion or other chemical processes. Each year \nmore than 100 million tons of smoke aerosols are released into the atmosphere as a result of \nbiomass burning. More than 80percent of this burning is in the tropical regions [1]. Smoke \nplumes can travel over hundreds or even thousands of kilometers horizontally and also reach \nup to stratosphere under certain atmospheric circulation conditions. Thus smoke can have an \nimpact far beyond the region of fire activity. Smoke play a major role on the radiation \nbalance of the earth-atmosphere system. Smoke particles scatter and absorb incoming solar \nradiation, thereby having a two-fold impact, i.e. a cooling effect at the surface, but warming \neffect on the atmosphere. Since the magnitude of the scattering effect outweighs that of \nabsorption, smoke has a net cooling effect at the top of the atmosphere-surface system. This \nis often called the direct effect of smoke aerosols [1]. \nSmoke can also modify the short wave reflective properties of clouds by acting as cloud \ncondensation nuclei [2]. Under a limited supply of water vapor, an increased number of \nnuclei  result in smaller cloud droplets that have higher reflectivity than larger cloud \ndroplets .This effect called the indirect radiative forcing, is difficult to quantify and has large \nuncertainties associated with the sign and magnitudes. \nUnderstanding such numerous and complex effects of smoke on weather and climate requires \na good knowledge of the spatial and temporal variation of smoke and its optical properties, \nwhich is only feasible by means of satellite observation.

In this \nsection we describe the theoretical basis and algorithm overview for identification of smoke. \n9.4.1 Overview \n \n9.4.1.1 Theoretical Background \nIdentification of smoke through satellite observations is a challenge in itself. The large \nspectral overlap in the spectral signature smoke and other scene types such as clouds and \nbackground surfaces has complicated the problem. Till date, very few studies have been done \nto discriminate smoke in a satellite imagery. The most commonly used method of identifying \nsmoke is to assign different colors to different channels or channel combinations. The \nresulting false-color images can provide visual separation of smoke from other objects. For \nexample, Kaufman et al. [2] assigned AVHRR channel 1 to red, channel 2 to green, and \ninverse channel 4 to blue, generating a composite image showing smoke plumes [3]. The \nHazard Mapping System (HMS) developed in 2001 by the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administrations (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite and Data \nInformation Service (NESDIS) also generated the smoke outlines manually, primarily \nutilizing animated visible band satellite imagery. \nSmoke plumes and their path can also be traced using temporal satellite imagery, through \nimage processing techniques. But this methodology is a manual detection technique and can \nhardly be used for automatic detection of smoke in satellite imageries. Some sporadic efforts \nin the direction of distinguishing smoke in satellite imagery has been made in the past. The \nGeostationary Operational Environmental Satellite GOES-8 employed the automated smoke/ \naerosol detection algorithm (ASADA) to monitor biomass burning in South America [4], \nwhile some attempts for automatic detection of smoke using artificial neural networks and \nthreshold approaches applied to AVHRR imagery was made by Li et al [3] \nIn general, smoke is composed of many small particles suspended in the air. These particles \nscatter and absorb (attenuate) different spectra of electromagnetic radiation. This absorption \nreduces transmittance of that radiation through the smoke. The effect of smoke aerosol as \nfunction of wavelength forms the crux of its satellite detection algorithm. Smoke has a large \neffect in the visible part of the spectrum, decreasing in magnitude with wavelength from the \nblue to the red region. In the near IR the effect is smaller than the variation in the surface \nreflectance between the smoke free area and the area affected by smoke. The smoke effect is \nnot observable in the mid IR (2.2 µm) region due to the large ratio of the wavelength of \nradiation to the size of particles. \nThus using visible channel it is possible to distinguish smoke plumes over land. But the \ndiffusion processes associated with smoke and clouds lead to fuzzy boundaries between them. \nHence although the reflectance of smoke is generally less than that of clouds, the latter has so \nlarge a range of variation that it is difficult to use it to discriminate smoke pixels from cloudy \npixels. Thus the biggest challenge in smoke detection is to isolate smoke from a  smoke/ \nHaze/ Cloud mix in a satellite imagery. Discrimination between smoke and clouds is \ngenerally made on the basis of cloud classification. \nSmoke \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n145\nThe channels Visible, MIR, TIR-1, TIR-2 of the INSAT-3D imager exhibit some distinction \nin the characteristics of smoke, clouds and underlying surface which is the basis of smoke \nidentification. \n \nAlgorithm Overview \nThe smoke detection algorithm proposed here employs multi-thresholding technique, which \nincludes single and multi band difference thresholds, corrected albedo calculations, sun glint \nmask and cloud edge detection. It first eliminates Smoke/ Cloud/ Haze free pixels and then \nscreens out different kinds of cloudy pixels to arrive at smoke pixels. In general, the \nreflectance and brightness temperature of dense smoke have intermediate values between \nthose of clouds and land. The reflectance of smoke is usually less than that of clouds, but \nhigher than that of the underlying surface, while the converse is true for brightness \ntemperature So double sided thresholding is applied in form of these five pass tests. \n \nFirst pass Test: \nA first pass thresholding is done on the visible channel counts to limit values indicative of \nhaze/cloud mix. \n \nSecond pass Test: \nSecond pass is albedo thresholding to further screen out cloud/ surface reflectance over \nland and water. \nAlbedo Calculation for the VIS channel \n \n where A is the albedo, Lr is the radiance, \nis the solar zenith angle and F0 is the incident \nradiance if the satellite were to look directly at the sun, which is computed as: \n \nwhere S  is the spectral irradiance of the sun and w is the spectral response function for the \nchannel. \n \nThird pass Test: \nSince sun glint often produces the same signature as smoke in visible imagery, regions with \nreflected solar angles less than a threshold value are not processed to avoid those areas \naffected by sun glint. \n \nFourth pass Test: \nThresholding on brightness temperature of MIR, TIR-1 and difference of these two channels \nis implemented to screen out opaque cirrus and stratus clouds. Since clouds usually have cold \ntops, they have low brightness temperatures in TIR-1 channel. Further the large difference in \nthe brightness temperatures between the MIR and the TIR-1 channels due to the reflection of \nsolar energy at 3.9µm is succesful in screening out water clouds. \n \nSmoke \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n146\nFifth pass Test: \nThresholds are placed on the brightness temperature of TIR-1, TIR-2 and difference of these \ntwo channels is implemented to screen out low level moisture and cirrus clouds. \nThresholding based on differences between brightness temperatures of TIR-1 and TIR-2 are \nwidely used for cloud screening and is often referred to as the split window technique.  \n \nPseudo Channel Index (PCI) Test : \nEven after applying the above tests , misclassification between smoke and clouds is possible. \nFor further screening, pseudo channel (CLD) is made use of and defined as: \nVisible)\n(\n(TIR2)\nVisible)\n(\n(TIR2)\nCLD\n\n\n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) \nwhere TIR2 and Visible refer to the radiation received in 12 μm and 0.65 μm channels \nrespectively [5]. \nOwing to their different signatures in the pseudo channel, smoke plumes and clouds can be \ndiscriminated using a CLD threshold. Although in earlier studies CLD and Normalized \nDifference Vegetation Index (NDVI) feature space analysis was used for categorization of \nsmoke and cloud, it was found to generate false alarms and was eventually improved by \nusing multi-temporal change detection technique. However, in this study, it has been found \nthat combining CLD with conventional multi-threshold test also improves the robustness of \nsmoke detection.  Thus pixels are further required to pass the following test, \n1\nCLD C\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(4) \nwhere ‘C1’ is the threshold value for smoke plumes. \n \nIf a pixel passes all these 5 tests, surrounding pixels are checked to screen out cloud edge \npixels.A flow diagram is given to illustrate the flow of the smoke detection algorithm. \n \n \nSmoke \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n147\n9.4.1.2 Flow Chart \n \n \n \nFigure 1: FLOW DIAGRAM FOR SMOKE DETECTION ALGORITHM \n \n9.4.2 Operational retrieval implementation \nThe operational implementation of the retrieval process can be enumerated as follows: \n1.

Defining of thresholds \nUsing training dataset of forest fires over the Indian region for VIS, MIR , TIR-1 and \nTIR-2 channels, thresholds have to be defined for tests listed above.

Aerosols have large-\nscale effects, such as their impact on climate by redistributing solar radiation (Herman \nand Browning 1975; Charlson et al. 1991; Haywood et al. 1999) and interacting with \nclouds (Platnick and Twomey 1994; Kaufman et al. 2002). Aerosol information is also \ncritical for atmospheric correction algorithms for multi-spectral satellite sensors and \nmilitary operations. The climate effects of atmospheric aerosols may be comparable to \nCO2 greenhouse effects, but with opposite sign and larger uncertainty (Hansen and Lacis, \n1990). Aerosols have a significant impact on human life beyond the climate element. \nWhen in the lower troposphere, aerosols cause poor air quality, reduction of visibility, \nand public health hazards. Satellite remote sensing provides a means to derive aerosol \ndistribution at global and regional scales.  \nThis Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) describes the algorithm used to \nretrieve the Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) for the INSAT-3D Imager instrument \noperating from a geostationary platform. The output product description is summarized in \nTable 1.  \nSpecifically, this document identifies the sources of input data, both INSAT-3D imager \nand non- INSAT-3D imager data, required for retrieval; provides the physical theory and \nmathematical background underlying the use of this information in the retrievals; \nincludes implementation details; and describes assumptions and limitations of the \nproposed approach. \nTable 1: Summary of Aerosol optical Depth (AOD) product \nParameter \nName  \nUnits  \nHorizontal Cell \nSize  \nComments  \nAerosol Optical \ndepth at 650 nm  \nDimensionless  4.0 Km for both \nLand and oceans  \nRetrieved for all the pixels \nexcept areas of clouds  \nAerosols \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n154\n10.2.2 Objective \nThe objective of this algorithm is to calculate the aerosol optical thickness, proportional \nto the total aerosol loading of the ambient aerosol, over both land and ocean for Indian \nregion on twice daily basis.  As clouds block the surface reflectance, the aerosol optical \nthickness cannot be found for cloudy pixels. Retrievals are only performed during the \ndaytime due to the lack of light in the visible channel of INSAT-3D imager data during \nthe nighttime. The overall objectives of the aerosol retrieval is: \nTo determine the aerosol optical thickness, at 650 nm and 4 Km spatial resolution over \nboth land and ocean surfaces with root mean square (RMS) error of ±0.1. Optical \nthickness () is related to transmission (t) by t=exp(-). Optical thickness retrievals apply \nonly under clear and daytime conditions. \n10.3 Inputs \n10.3.1 Static Data  \nParameter \nResolution \nQuantization \nAccuracy \nSource \n \nDigital \nElevation \nmodel  \n \n5 minutes  \n        \n-- \n \n-- \n \nETOPO5 \n \nSpectral \nResponse \nFunction \n(SRF) for \nImager bands  \n \n \n1nm  \n \n-- \n \n-- \n \nSensor Group \nof Space \nApplications \nCentre, \nAhmedabad \n   \n10.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) \nParameter \nResolution \nQuantization \nAccuracy \nSource \nRadiometric \nand geometric \ncorrected \nradiance values \nof visible \nchannel (0.55-\n0.75 m) \n4 Km  \n10 bit \n-- \nDerived from \nraw data by \nDP (data \nprocessing) \nRadiometric \nand geometric \ncorrected gray \ncount values of \nTIR-1 channel \n(10.5) \n4 Km \n10 bit \n- \nDerived from \nraw data by \nDP \nRadiometric \nand geometric \ncorrected gray \n4 Km  \n10 bit \n- \nDerived from \nraw data by \nDP \nAerosols \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n155\ncount values of \nTIR-2 channel \n(11.5) \nGeolocation file \nAlong with sun \nzenith & \nazimuth and \nsensor zenith \nand azimuth \ninformation \nPixel \n- \n1 pixel \nDerived by \nDP \n \nAt least 20 data \ndata for Visible \nband should be \navailable for \n1030 and 1330 \nhrs for the \ngeneration of \nClear \ncomposite \nreflectance \nimage for initial \nperiod   \n \n4 Km  \n \n \n \n \n10.3.3 Other Auxillary data and Model Inputs \nParameter \nResolution \nQuantization \nAccuracy \nSource \n \nTotal Column \nOzone \nconcentration  \n \n \n50 Km  \n        \n-- \n \n-- \nNCEP or \nINSAT-3D \nSOUNDER \n \nSurface \npressure  \n \n \n50 Km  \n \n-- \n \n-- \nNCEP or \nGTS through \nIMD \n10.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications \n \n10.4.1 Overview \nIt has been demonstrated that aerosol optical thickness can be retrieved from solar-\nreflected radiance, and that aerosol size distribution information is carried in the spectral \ndependence of aerosol optical thickness. Thus, satellite reflectance measurement limited \nto one (GOES) or two channels (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer [AVHRR]) \nwere used first to derive the total aerosol content by assuming a given aerosol model.  \nThe relatively homogeneous surface of the ocean enables the direct application of the \nlook up table (LUT) approach to find the aerosol optical thickness. Using the observed \nAerosols \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n156\nreflectance at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) in coordination with ancillary information \non the wind speed, water vapor, surface pressure, surface elevation, and ozone, the \ncorrected reflectances are inverted into a maritime LUT to find values of optical \nthickness. \nThe approach over land is more complicated, in that dark, vegetated surfaces are required \nfor aerosol optical depth retrieval. A near-IR band is used to identify dark, vegetated \npixels, then the surface reflectance in the visible bands is calculated from the observed \nreflectance in the near-IR band. The optical thickness is initially calculated assuming a \ncontinental aerosol model. The suspended matter information is used to choose a better \naerosol model and more accurate values of optical thickness (Kaufmann et al. 1997). \nIn spite of advances in aerosol remote sensing over land, most retrievals are limited to \nonce or  twice per day, as by the morning and afternoon passes of the orbiting polar \nsatellites. Aerosols, however, show diurnal variations that would be missed by such \nsparse observations. While studies of aerosol optical depth from Sun photometers show \nlittle systematic trends (Smirnov et al. 2002), surface observations of scattering show \nsignificant diurnal patterns. It is required to understand aerosol plume movement to track \nand forecast plume movement in the interest of human health. Therefore, it is important \nto monitor the temporal aspects of aerosol. \nThe INSAT-3D imager data from geostationary platform has the potential to provide \naerosol observations over land and ocean with multiple observations per day.  Many \nstudies have demonstrated the potential of Geostationary Operational Environmental \nSatellite (GOES) series of imager sensors to provide quantitative estimates of aerosol \noptical depth. Their sensitivity studies, however, concluded that retrievals depend on \naerosol optical property assumptions and surface reflectance. Studies using  geostationary \nsatellites (e.g. GOES-8) and larger validation networks (e.g. Aerosol Robotic Network—\nAERONET) supported those initial findings. Specifically, Zhang et al. (2001) and Knapp \net al. (2002) showed that aerosol monitoring from GOES is possible for South America. \nHowever, this region has optimal retrieval conditions: surface cover with little variability \n(i.e. rainforest) and large aerosol optical depths (from biomass burning). \nRecent study by Knapp et al. (2005) has shown operational potential of GOES series of \nsensors for the monitoring of aerosol optical depth over land. A method is proposed by \nKnapp et al (2005) to correct surface effects and retrieve aerosol optical depth using \nvisible reflectance measurements from the Geostationary Operational Environmental \nSatellite (GOES). The surface contribution is determined from temporal compositing of \nvisible imagery, where darker pixels correspond to less atmospheric attenuation and \nsurface reflectance is deduced from the composite using radiative transfer. The method is \napplied to GOES-8 imagery over the eastern US. Retrieved surface reflectance is \ncompared with separate retrievals using a priori ground based observations of aerosol \noptical depth.  \n10.4.1.1 \nTheoretical Background \nThe INSAT-3D imager data will be used to perform the surface reflectance and aerosol \noptical depth () retrievals and mask for clouds. It measures top of the atmosphere (TOA) \nradiance in six channels: three at infrared wavelengths, one in the visible wavelength and \none sensitive to both solar and Earth-emitted radiance. Primarily, the visible channel \nAerosols \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n157\n(0.52–0.72 mm full width at half maximum) is sensitive to aerosol scattering, so the \nremaining channels are used for cloud masking. The cloud mask algorithm is based on \nthe Clouds from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) (CLAVR) \nalgorithm (Stowe et al. 1999) which uses spectral and spatial thresholds to test for the \npresence of clouds. \nThe retrieval of aerosol information from INSAT-3D imager data is a two-step process: \n1)  Cloud  masking  \n2) Composite the visible images to estimate the surface reflectance, and \n3) Use the surface reflectance with an image to retrieve the aerosol optical  depth.   \n      Cloud Masking  \nClouds are generally characterized by higher reflectance and lower temperature than the \nunderlying earth surface.  As such, simple visible and infrared window threshold \napproaches offer considerable  skill  in  cloud  detection. Following threshold based tests \nwill be performed to detect the cloudy pixles. \na)   Visible and  Mid-wave Infrared Window Reflectance Threshold Test \nThe reflectance threshold test using visible band of INSTA-3D along with 3.9 micron \nchannel where values > 6% are considered to be cloudy, will be used.    \nb)  IR Window Temperature Threshold and Difference Tests \nSimple thresholds based cloud screening test will be established over land  and ocenic \nfeatures using the TIR data of the INSAT-3D.  \n      Surface Reflectance Retrieval \nEstimating the surface contribution to the TOA INSAT-3D Imager visible reflectance is \ndifficult since observations will have atmospheric contamination. For instance, a visible \nobservation from INSAT-3D Imager on a cloudless day with low aerosol burden will still \nhave: gaseous absorption (primarily, ozone and water vapour); Rayleigh scattering; and \nresidual aerosol extinction. This atmospheric component to the TOA reflectance needs to \nbe removed to retrieve the surface reflectance. While studies have shown it is possible to \nestimate the surface component from observations in the near-infrared (e.g. 2.1 m) \nwhere aerosol and Rayleigh scattering are very low, the INSAT-3D imager lacks an \nobservation at this wavelength. Therefore, a compositing method will be used to estimate \nthe surface reflectance. \nThe visible imagery is composited to determine the surface contribution to the top-of-the- \natmosphere (TOA) reflectance. For each pixel in the visible image, the darkest \nobservation over the course of some time period is called the composite clear reflectance. \nBy using this value to obtain the surface reflectance, one assumes: that aerosol would \nincrease the reflectance and cloud shadows will be rare. The length of the time period is \nsomewhat subjective. In general, a long enough time period is needed for at least one \ncloud-free observation. Knapp et. al. (2005)  used a two week (i.e., 14 day) period. A \nradiative transfer model, the second simulation of satellite signal in the in the solar \nspectrum (6S) will be used to convert the TOA observed reflectance to a surface \nreflectance. This atmospheric correction removes Rayleigh scattering and gaseous \nAerosols \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n158\nabsorption, leaving the Lambertian surface reflectance. This is then used in following \ncalculations to retrieve aerosol optical depth in the subsequent aerosol optical depth \nretrieval. \nCloud shadows, however, can contaminate the composite reflectance. At high solar zenith \nangles (i.e. during early morning and late afternoon), high clouds may cast large \nshadows. In the shadow regions, the direct downward solar radiance is obscured at the \nsurface, thereby reducing the surface reflectance. The second  darkest  observation  will \nbe   used in  the  composite clear reflectance (CCR) method to reduce the effect of cloud \nshadows. By selecting the second darkest pixel, a cloud shadow would need to be present \non at least two days during the period to affect the composite. \nThe accuracy of the composite depends on the length of time used to create it. For \ninstance, enough cloud-free observations must exist with little aerosol influence for the \nsurface reflectance to be accurate. Areas of persistent aerosol or cloud cover will be \nlikely to have caused errors in the retrieved surface reflectance because the atmospheric \ncomponent remains large in such situations. \nAtmospheric effects—aerosol extinction, Rayleigh scattering and gaseous absorption —\nwill be removed from the composite using the second simulation of the satellite signal in \nthe solar spectrum (6S) radiative transfer model. This will retrieve the surface reflectance, \nsfc.  \nSome aerosols are still present in the composite reflectance; their radiative effect must be \nremoved as well. This aerosol will be simulated using rural and dust aerosol model, given \nits ability to simulate the aerosol signal over the Indian region. This will represent the \naerosol extinction still present in a composite reflectance. The amount of background \naerosol is difficult to determine because it varies with season, length of CCR and time of \nday. However, it has been reported that background aerosol can vary from 0.02 to 0.08. \n     Aerosol Optical Depth Retrieval \nThe aerosol optical depth retrieval is performed using a INSAT-3D imager visible image \nand the retrieved surface reflectance (from the previous step). In this retrieval, the optical \ndepth of the rural and dust model in the 6S radiative transfer model is increased until the \ntheoretical reflectance matches that in the INSAT-3D imager observation.  \nThe second simulation (6S) model will be used to  simulate sat  observations.  Satellite \naltitude INSAT-3D imager visible band (0.55-0.75 m)  radiances will be simulated as a \nfunction of geometric angles  determining the satellite viewing geometry and time of the \nday, surface reflectance R, and aerosol optical depth ( varying from 0 to 3) at 650 nm.  \nThe  aerosol optical depth  will be retrieved using a look up table (LUT). The retrieval \nmethod then will depend on the interpolation within the LUT, finding the t which \ncorresponds to the observed sat .   The uncertainties in such a retrieval is dependent upon \nthe accuracy of the model parameters \n \n \n \nAerosols \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n159\n10.4.1.2 \n Flow Chart \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10.4.2 Operational Implementation \n \n10.4.2.1 \nStep 1 : Conversion from gray count to Visible radiance and  BT \n \n10.4.2.2 \nStep 2 : Cloud  and sun glint elimination \n \n10.4.2.3 \nStep 3 : Generation of surface reflectance image using darkest \nobservations using last 20 days data  \n \n10.4.2.4 \n Step 4: Atmospheric correction of INSAT-3D visible image for molecular \nscattering and gaseous absorption  \n \n10.4.2.5 \nStep 5 : Correction for surface reflectance  \n10.4.2.6 \nStep 6:  Use LUTs for the inversion of aerosol optical depth (AOD) \n \nAerosols \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n160\n10.5 \nOutputs \nParameter \nUnit \nMin \nMax \nAccuracy \nResolution \nAerosol \noptical \ndepth at \n650 nm  \nDimensionless  0 \n2 \n15-20% \n4 Km  \n \n10.5.1 format of the output and the domain \n        Lat , Lon, AOD ,   \n \nDomain : \n40  to 40 N, 30 E to 120 E \n10.6 \nValidation \n10.6.1 Data required \n Parameter \nResolution \nQuantization \nAccuracy \nSource \nAERONET \nspectral AOD \ndata   \n \nIn-situ point \nobservation  \n        \n-- \n \n-- \nAERONET \nsites in India  \nKanpur, Goa \nand Dharwar  \nSpectral AOD \nusing \nhandheld \nsunphotometer \n \n In-situ point \nobservation \n \n-- \n \n-- \nData \ncollection \ncampaigns \nwill be \norganized  \nMODIS AOD \nproducts  \n \n1 degree X 1 \ndegree  \n \n \nData available \nthrough \ninternet  \n \n10.6.2 Methods of validation \n      AERONET data for Validation  \nPost-launch routine ground-based observations can be made using AERONET, and any \nof the several miscellaneous techniques, including the diffuse/direct method, aureole \nmeters, and polarization measurements.

The INSAT-3D will have two IR window channels (10.5-11.5 m, and 11.5-\n12.5 m). In this document some background and general characteristic of satellite-derived \nCMV and INSAT-3D IR channel characteristics; the methodology employed to derive the \nvector fields, theoretical basis and practical aspects of this algorithm and outlined the \nplanned validation approach. \n   \n   11.2.1 Overview and background  \n Spatio–temporal analysis of meteorological events is an important part of routine numerical \nweather analysis. In that context, a cloud tracking method is presented here for a sequence of \ngeostationary satellite images. Given a pair of remotely sensed images, captured at a fixed \ntime interval (typically, 30 min), the objective is to derive motion vectors associated with the \ncloud mass. This correspondence process is a useful precursor to cloud motion vector (CMV) \nstudies and spatio–temporal analysis of cloud life cycles. The spatio–temporal life cycle \nincludes the generation, dissipation and assimilation of clouds that can be observed in a \nsequence of geostationary satellite images. During the 1970’s and early 1980’s, cloud motion \nwinds were produced in major operational centers like NESDIS (National Environmental \nSatellite Data and Information Service) using a combination of automated and manual \ntechniques. Early automated techniques supplied quality low-level vectors but often yielded \nin consistent quality for mid- and high-level motions. Height assignment was automatic but \noften contained errors for semitransparent cirrus clouds. In the subsequent years, due to the \ndevelopments in image-processing and pattern recognition techniques (Merill et al., 1991), it \nCloud motion vector \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n166\nwas possible to design fully automatic techniques for CMV retrieval, and NESDIS began its \napplication in 1992. In later time, several new developments were made to make accurate \nretrievals of cloud motion winds. For example, CO2 slicing algorithm was replaced by H2O \nintercept algorithm for   assigning the height to semitransparent tracers. Other improvements \nwere (i) automated correction of navigation inconsistencies within the imageries (ii) \ninclusion of spatial filters in tracer selection methodology to filter undesirable scenes. \n \n11.2.2 Objective \nThe main objective of this study is to derive the Cloud Motion Vectors (CMVs) over land \nand sea using multiple half hourly IR images.

Any \ngradients greater than 15K are assigned as target locations, and prospective targets also \nundergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter out unwanted \ntargets. Water vapor tracers are generally identified using the local bi-directional gradients in \na template of specified size and compared with empirically determined thresholds to identify \nthe features with sufficient variability (Velden et al., 1997) and those that pass the threshold \nvalue are identified as tracers for cloud-free environments. The pixel with maximum bi-\ndirectional gradient is the location of the tracer. At the European Organization for the \nExploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the tracers in the Meteosat (first-\ngeneration satellites) images are selected using multispectral histogram analysis (Tomassini, \n1981), which extracts the dominating scenes in an image segment corresponding to the area \nof 32 X 32  IR pixels at the sub-satellite point. Later the selected templates undergo a spatial \ncoherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter the image, to enhance the upper-\nlevel cloud. Because the spatial resolution of the infrared channel of Kalpana-1 (8 km) is \ncoarser relative to GOES (5 km) or Meteosat-7 (5 km), we used a 20 X 20 window (called a \ntemplate) to identify features in Kalpana-1 images. However in case of INSAT-3D (4 km) we \nused 32 x 32 template window. The features are selected by computing local image anomaly \nin a 32 x 32 template window, both in cloudy and cloud free regions. The local image \nanomaly is calculated using the following formula: \n                        \n\n\n\ni\nj\nI\nj\ni\nI\na\n)\n,\n(\n                             (1) \nWhere \nj\ni\nI ,\n represent the grey value for (i, j) pixel of a template window and bar represents \nthe mean of grey values within that template. The anomaly-based tracers are generally \nproduced by a smooth feature field in comparison to the gradient-based features. This \ndifference can help in reducing the tracking errors (Deb et al., 2008). As per the location of \nthe tracer, the template window is re-located with tracer position at the centre. A schematic \ndiagram is shown in Fig. 2 \n11.4.1.1.2 Height assignment \nThe height assignments of the selected tracers selected based on the above criterion are \nderived using the following widely used methods viz. such as the infrared window (WIN) \ntechnique or the water vapor histogram method (HIST), the H2O intercept method (Nieman et \nal., 1993) and the cloud base method (LeMarshall, 1993). Once final height is selected a few \ngross error checks are also applied. A brief description of each method is following: \n2.1 Infrared Window Channel (WIN) and Water Vapor Histogram Methods \n(HIST): \nIn this method the height assignment using a single satellite channel is made by comparing \neither infrared window or water vapor brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model \nCloud motion vector \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n168\nforecast temperature profiles. Cloud heights are determined by interpolating the cloud \ntemperature, which is an average of coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess \nfield at the target location. A 6-h NWP model forecast from National Center for \nEnvironmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) is the source of \ntemperature profile. This method works well with opaque clouds. However, movement of \nopaque clouds usually does not accurately represent atmospheric motion at the assigned level \n(Nieman et al., 1993), resulting in a lower derived wind speed than observed. \nSemitransparent clouds or sub-pixel clouds give more accurate representation of the actual \nmovement of the atmosphere at a particular level. Estimation of this level is very difficult in \nthese cases since determination of the cloud top BT is affected by an unknown cloud \nemissivity or the percentage of cloud versus clear sky, respectively. The BT values are \nwarmer than observed in these cases, thus leading to estimated cloud heights that are too high \nin pressure (too low in altitude), typically resulting in an overestimation of the wind speed at \nthe estimated cloud height.  \n2.2 Water Vapor−Infrared Window Intercept Method (H2O):  \nHeight assignments derived with this method are based upon the fact that radiances from two \ndifferent spectral bands are linearly related for different cloud amounts within the field of \nview at a specified height. Observed radiance measurements are a function of clear sky and \nopaque cloud radiances.        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nc\nbcd\ncl\nP\nN\nnER\nN\nR\nnE\nN\nR\n,\n1\n\n\n\n               (2)   \nOpaque cloud radiance can be calculated from: \n\n\n\n\n\n\ndp\ndp\np\nT\nN\ndb\nP\nN\nt\nN\nR\nP\nN\nR\ns\nc\np\np\ncl\nc\nbcd\n)\n(\n,\n,\n,\n\n\n\n     (3) \nwhere \nbcd\nR\n is the opaque (\"black\") cloud radiance, Rc1 is the clear sky radiance, t(N,p) is the \nfractional transmittance of radiation of spectral band N emitted from the atmospheric \npressure p arriving at the top of the atmosphere (p=0), n is the fraction of FOV covered with \ncloud, Ps is the surface pressure, Pc is the cloud pressure, and b[N,T(p)] is the Planck \nradiance of the spectral band N for a temperature T(p). The second part of the above equation \nrepresents the radiance decrease from clear sky conditions introduced by an opaque cloud at \na pressure level p. This calculation is dependent upon an \"accurate\" estimation of the current \natmospheric temperature and moisture structure, which are provided by a NWP model \nforecast profile. By comparing the observed radiances with the calculated radiances (for an \nobserved atmosphere defined by the model guess profiles), an estimation of the cloud height \ncan be derived for a completely opaque cloud. In the Fig. 1, observed WV and IR radiances \nat each field of view (FOV) points are plotted with the calculated radiances at different \nheights for opaque clouds in the atmosphere (curved line). The straight line connects the \ncenter points of the warmest and coldest clusters, which approximate the observed surface \nand cloud conditions.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCloud motion vector \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n169\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig 1: Measured radiances (mW m−2 sr−1 cm) for fields of view partially filled with clouds (Nieman \net al., 1993) \n \nBy extrapolating this line to intersect the calculated radiance curve, where the cloud amount \nis one (representing an opaque cloud), the cloud top temperature/pressure can be determined. \nThe cluster determination algorithm used is a modified version of the bivariate asymmetric \nGaussian histogram analysis (Rossow et al., 1985; Tomassini, 1981), and involves ten steps. \nThese steps are outlined in detail in Nieman et al., 1993. Calculated water vapor radiances \ncan be in error due to incorrect NWP model forecast profiles. This error would lead to \ncalculated radiances being systematically higher or lower than observed radiances. When the \ncalculated radiances are systematically lower, an adjustment is applied to the radiances \nobtained using the above equation. When the calculated radiances are greater than observed \nradiances, no adjustment is applied since it is assumed that the lower measured radiance is \ndue to cloud contamination. The accuracy of this method can be affected by the amount of \nwater vapor in the atmosphere. Dry atmospheric conditions lead to a steeper slope between \nthe IR and WV radiances, leading to an overestimate in the target height (lower pressure \nvalue). The NCEP GFS model forecast are used here as guess fields. \n2.3 Cloud Base Method (BASE): \nWind speeds for low-level cumulus clouds (cloud top pressures greater than 600 hPa or \naltitudes lower than 600 hPa) have been found to be best represented by the movement at the \ncloud base level instead of the mid or upper levels of the cloud (Hasler et al., 1979). A \nmethod was developed at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (LeMarshall, 1993) to \nestimate this height using the Infrared Window channel. This method first constructs a \nhistogram of the BT values over a selected region surrounding the cloud target being \nexamined. This histogram is then smoothed and Hermite polynomials are fitted to the \nhistogram to separate the distribution into two components; a cloudy and clear sky region. \nAssuming the distributions are normal, the cloud base height can be estimated. The mid \ncloud temperature is determined by examining the second derivative histogram of the cloudy \ndistribution, while the cloud top temperature is estimated to be located at the coldest 5% of \nthe cloudy distribution. The cloud base temperature is estimated to be located the same \ndistance from the mid cloud temperature as the cloud top temperature. The calculated cloud \nbase temperature is converted to a pressure using model field interpolated to the target \nCloud motion vector \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n170\nlocation. As mentioned previously, this height assignment method is only applied to those \ntargets which are calculated to have a cloud top pressure of greater than 600 hPa (i.e. altitude \nlower than 600 hPa). This \"initial\" target cloud top height is provided by one of the previous \nInfrared Window height assignment methods. The BASE method is used to adjust only these \nwinds, and is not utilized for water vapor winds or winds with pressures less than 600 hPa \n(i.e. altitudes higher than 600 hPa).  \nOnce the infrared tracers heights using the above three algorithms and water vapor tracers \nheights using the HIST and H2O methods have been calculated, the best height among the \navailable heights is determined. The lowest pressure (highest altitude) value of all the \ncalculated height values is used as the final pressure height. However, if for a specific \ninfrared tracer final height is WIN and a valid BASE height is available, then the BASE \nheight is used as the final height. \n11.4.1.1.3 Tracking \nIf a traceable feature is found in the first image and corresponding height of the selected \ntracers are estimated, the match of this template is searched in the second image within a \nbigger ‘‘search window’’, centered at the same point as the template window. To optimize \nthe search window size, the first guess model wind direction at the tracer location is also \nconsidered. The search area is optimized within ±30 degree from the model wind direction at \nthat level of atmosphere. The 32 X 32 template in the second image that lies within the \nsearch window should have the same class as the template in the first image; otherwise the \ntemplate in the second window is rejected. The cross-correlation technique is used \noperationally for tracking the tracer between two images in most operational centers. \nHowever, in this study the degrees of matching between two successive images are \ncalculated by the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) coefficient (E). \nIt is defined as \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\ni\nt\nt\nn\ni\ns\nt\nI\nI\nI\nI\nE\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n \n \n \n(4) \nWhere \ntI and \nsI  are the variance of the grey values for template window and search window \nand \ntI is the average of variance of template window.  Here n is 32 x 32 and this is the size of \ntemplate window and corresponding template of same size in the searching area. The size of \nthe searching area in the subsequent image is taken as 64 x 64. The coefficient E is \nnormalized to values between – and +1. An efficiency E = 1 corresponds to a perfect match, \nE = 0 means that search window is as accurate as mean of the template window and E < 0 \nimplies the lack of matching between template and search window. The closer the model \nefficiency to 1, the more accurate the matching between the windows. A cut-off value of \nE=0.8 is defined, below which a matching of target is not considered. The Nash-Sutcliffe \nmodel efficiency coefficient (E) is normalized and its value lies between - and 1, towards \nthe higher end (e.g. as E  1.0), the value of E approaches r2, where r is the correlation \ncoefficient. Thus a value of E=1 is exactly equivalent to a correlation of 1.0 between two \nobjects.  The maximum value of E is chosen as the best fit for tracking. One of the main \nadvantages of this matching technique is that it reduces the possibility of multiple maxima, \nbecause the parameter E has a higher sensitivity to differences between two features \nCloud motion vector \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n171\ncompared to maximum cross correlation coefficient (MCC). Thus, when the degree of \nmismatch between two objects increases, the value of E falls more sharply compared to that \nof MCC, making E a better index for matching two objects. The application of this tracking \nmethod in estimation of water vapor winds has shown some improvement over Indian Ocean \nregion (Deb et al., 2008).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitial grids for target \nselection  \nTracer area \nbefore \noptimization \nTracer area \nafter \noptimization \nTracer area after \noptimization \n(image-1) \nSearch Window  \n(image-2) \nFig.2 : Steps involved in tracer selection and tracking \nCloud motion vector \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n172\n11.4.1.1.4: Wind buffer generation and Quality control \nQuality indicator of a derived wind vectors is traditionally represented as the degree of the \ncoherence of a given vector with its surrounding. In most of the operational centers the \nAMVs are derived from three successive satellite images and the quality control of the \nretrieved winds are done either through Quality Indicator (QI) (Holmlund, 1998) followed at \nEUMETSAT or through 3-dimensional recursive filter function  followed at NESDIS \n(Nieman et al., 1997) or both the algorithms together. In the present study a new technique of \nwind buffer generation and subsequently QI procedure followed at EUMETSAT is proposed. \nIn this technique, a wind buffer is created using previous eight images between a pair of \nimages (viz. between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored in a file (Fig. 3).  The \nprevious eight images were considered to maintain the minimum 4-hour decorrelation \ntimescale during retrieval (Kaur et al., 2011). In quality control procedure consists of a \ncoherence analysis which forms the basis for acceptance/rejection of a vector and degree of \ncoherence computed is used to assign quality flags to the derived vector. The value of quality \nflag falls sharply by an exponential function, as the disagreement of a given vector with its \nsurroundings increases. Here each vector wind is represented by a complex \nnumber\nj\ni\nj\ni\nc\nj\ni\nv\ni\nu\nV\n,\n,\n,\n\n\n. For every new vector under consideration, (from current image-\npair), its vector difference from the buffer is computed at the same as well as 3 X 3 \nneighborhood (Fig. 3), provided, the vectors to be compared show similar brightness \ncharacteristics (to maintain the similar height). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig 3: A schematic diagram of quality control process. \n \nHere X (cross sign) at the centre of first box represents the current vector under consideration \nand O (circle sign) represents spatial and temporal neighborhood vectors.

If all spatial and temporal \nCloud motion vector \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n173\nneighborhood vectors are present, then the difference set will contain 72 vectors (9 spatial \nneighborhoods with 8 temporal scales). However, all vectors may not be there all the times. \nThe quality control process begins if at least 10 vector differences\ndif\nV\n, excluding the \ndifference corresponding to current (i, j), are present in the set. In the next step, set of vector \ndifferences \n\ndif\nV\n is arranged in ascending order. The quality control process begins is the \naverage of 10 \ndif\nV\n is greater than 2.5 m/s. In the next step, the QI value for each vector is \ndetermined by using EUMETSAT procedure where four different tests are performed, which \nis normalized by a tanh-function that returns the value between 0 and 1. A weighted average \nof these individual quality indicators is then used for screening of poor quality vectors from \nfinal output. If any vector is not present in the immediate two pairs, then in-stead of rejecting, \nsearch process goes to the previous time steps of the wind buffer and if still it is not present it \ngoes to next previous times steps and so on. \n \n          If  S is the mean “speed” of a vector computed from two pair of images, then different \nquality functions are computed as below : \n       \n Direction Consistency Function: \n          \n1\n)\n)\n/\nexp(\ntanh(\n0.1\n1\n1\n1\nD\nC\nB\nS\nA\nDCF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n     \n       Speed Consistency Function: \n          \n2\n)\n)\n,\n(\ntanh(\n0.1\n2\n2\n2\nD\nC\nB\nS\nA\nMAX\nS\nSCF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n             Vector Consistency Function: \n          \n3\n)\n)\n,\n(\ntanh(\n0.1\n3\n3\n3\nD\nC\nB\nS\nA\nMAX\nV\nVCF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n   Spacial Consistency Function: \n          \n4\n)\n)\n,\n(\ntanh(\n0.1\n2\n4\n4\nD\nm\nC\nB\nS\nA\nMAX\nV\nPCF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \nIn the above formulation, \nV\nS \n\n\n,\n,\n\nrepresent the difference of direction (degrees), \ndifference of speed, and the length of the difference vector between first and second satellite \nwind component. \nm\nV\n\nis the length of difference vector between satellite wind component \nand its best neighbor. The best neighbor is determined by the smallest vector difference. \nQuantities AN,BN,CN, and DN are constants. The final quality indicator of a wind vector is \ngiven as  \n                          QI = \n0.4\nPCF\nVCF\nSCF\nDCF\n\n\n\n \n        All the vectors with QI < 0.6 are rejected.  \nIn the conventional triplet based methodology requires that a vector is available in both sets \n(i.e. in 1-2 and 2-3), if not so, such vectors are rejected, because they don’t get “support”. \nCloud motion vector \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n174\nHundreds of “isolated” vectors thus get eliminated, even though they represent the real \nsituation. In the current method, the vector under consideration receives support from the \npast eight images. This method produces higher number of valid retrieval in the low-level \nand captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. To explain this more explicitly, \nif we take eight satellite images each with 30-minute interval stating at 00:00 UTC to 03:30 \nUTC, then winds retrieved using each-image pair are stored as buffer in a file and \nrepresented as wind buffer generated at 03:30 UTC. The buffer generated at 03:30 UTC is \nused for quality control for wind retrieved using 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images and the \nsecond image time is given as actual observation time of retrieved wind. For example winds \nretrieved using 03:30 UTC wind buffer and 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images is given as \n04:00 UTC observation time. As a whole to complete the process once it requires nine \nimages. Similarly the buffer is updated at every 30-minute with the latest available image and \nprocess is repeated for next cycle of wind retrieval. This method produces higher number of \nvalid retrieval in all levels and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. \n \n11.4.2 Operational Implementation \n \n11.4.2.1 Step 1 : Conversion from gray count to BT \n In this step a radiation model will be used to convert the instrument measured \nradiances into brightness temperature.

The \nmean bias for both sets of winds should be about zero. \n11.7  Technical Issues (Limitations etc) \nAccuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the registration of the images. If \nthe registration has an error of 1 pixel, then error of the final product will be increased. \nHowever the following limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind. The \nspatially coherent, high resolution coverage of upper tropospheric winds are possible \nfrom geostationary satellite remote sensing of water vapor. CMV are comparable in \nquality to operational upper-level cloud-motion vectors. However, the retrieved vectors \nin regions are lacking in defining moisture structure, though they have the ability to \nobtain track-able information in extremely dry air masses and regions of strong \nsubsidence is limited. The individual vectors represent single level reports; however, \nupper level vertical winds profiles are possible by using multi-spectral observations. \n   \n1. \nSensitivity of error in height assignment to the error in wind speed \nretrieval \nThis sensitivity will depend upon the structure of wind circulation over different \nvertical levels as well as different geographical regions. For example, in the vicinity \nof atmospheric jets, the retrieved wind vectors will be highly sensitive to the errors in \nthe assigned pressure levels. Based on some standard analysis ( e.g. NCEP reanalysis \nof 6-hourly sampling), we will provide a quantitative assessment of the vertical and \nspatial structure of this sensitivity. \n \n2. \nNumerical model to be used for AMV height assignment \nWe plan to use IMD’s operational regional model output during height assignment \nprocedure. However, if the domain of this regional model is smaller than the area of \nAMV retrieval, either IMD may be requested to increase the domain of its operational \nmodel, or a lower-quality solution based on the output of coarser-resolution GCM \nwill be generated over the regions not covered by IMD’s regional model. \n \n3. Whether RT model to be used in real-time for height assignment   \nTo use RT model in real-time height-assignment application is generally required to \nfind the optimum solution. However, it is computationally expensive and may \nincrease the AMV turn-around time very significantly. Efforts are currently underway \nto develop an empirical version of RT model that can be used for simulation of IR \nand water-vapor channel radiances for a variety of cloud heights. The inverse of this \nempirical model will then be used in real-time applications.  \n \n4. \nComparison of maximum-correlation and minimum-difference methods \nfor tracking of cloud-tracers. \nThe comparison have been made for a large number of image samples and it was \nfound that the efficiencies of minimum-difference method (MDM) and maximum \nCloud motion vector \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n178\ncross correlation (MCC) methods are comparable, while the MDM method is \nsignificantly faster than MCC.    \n11.8   References \n \n \n1.

The INSAT-\n3D will have one water vapor channel (6.3 -7.1 (m). In this document some background \nand general characteristic of satellite-derived WVWV products, the methodology employed \nto derive the vector fields, theoretical basis and practical aspects of this algorithm and \noutlined the planned validation approach. \n     12.2.1 Overview and background  \nIn early nineties, forecasters have used extensively the water vapor radiances from geo-\nstationary satellites qualitatively (Weldon and Holmes 1991). In quantitative studies, the \nfirst attempt was made by Hayden and Stewart (Hayden and Stewart 1987) by manually \ntracking moisture features in automated image sequences. Later studies (Laurent 1993, \nVelden 1993, Holmlund 1993) on this area have shown much maturity with ability of \nautomated wind extraction methods for producing spatially coherent Water Vapor Wind \nVector (WVWV) fields comparable in quality to operational cloud-tracked winds. The \nsuccessful implementation of University of Wisconsin-Madison Co-operative Institute for \nMeteorological \nSatellite \nStudies \n(CIMSS) \nautomated \nwind-extraction \nalgorithm \noperationally at National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS) \nhave shown considerable improvement in this regards (Nieman et. al 1997). However, the \nquality control (QC) of WVWV fields still demanded intensive manual intervention. In \n1992, NESDIS began the use of first version of new automated winds (CIMSS) software \nWater vapor wind \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n183\npackage and producing full disk wind set without manual intervention since 1997 by \nsuitably selecting tracers (filtering undesirable scenes) and assigning heights using several \nmethods. The tracking features in subsequent imagery was automated using advanced \npattern matching techniques (Merrill et al. 1991) and an automated quality control \nalgorithm was also implemented. Laurent (1993) reports on Water Vapor (WV) wind \nextraction from Meteosat image data that is carried out under operational conditions. \nSubsequent years further development has been made by adding quality indicators \n(Holmlund 1998) to supply the users with additional information about the products. The \nU.S Geo-stationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES-8 etc series) are equipped \nwith one imager and two sounder water vapor channels. As of GOES-12 the spatial \nresolution of the WV imager has been improved from 8Km to 4 Km at the sub-satellite \npoint, and the radiometer is spectrally wider with a central wavelength of 6.5 micro m \ninstead 6.7 micro m. The sounders look progressively deeper into the troposphere as the \nspectral band wavelength moves away from the 6.3micro m absorption band center. \n(Menzel et al 1998). This facts opens the opportunity for a 3-dimensional reconstruction of \natmospheric motions (Menzel 2001). Water vapor winds from image data taken by the WV \nchannel aboard the Japanese satellite Geo-stationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS)-5 \nhave been produced since 1995, and clear-sky WV segments have been separated since \n1998 (Tokuno 1996, 1998). Tokuno et al. (2002) state that the appropriate height \nassignment of clear-sky WV motion vectors is still an unresolved task. \nGeo-stationary satellites of the Fengyun-2 series are operated by the National Satellite \nMeteorological Center of China since 1997 (Xu et al. 1998). These satellites are equipped \nwith a water vapor channel as well. The method to evaluate atmospheric motion vectors \ncompromises new features (Xu et al. 2002) that are unconventional relative to the earlier \nschemes applied to the data from Meteosat or GOES. \nThe study Buche et al. (2006) has shown improvement in Water Vapor structure \ndisplacements both in smooth and shallow scenes by using proper filters. He then tested a \nseries of height assignment methods using altitude-based parameters such as wind shear \nand brightness contrast of pixels. This study reveals that for the cases of strong wind shear \nthe methods that use the effective brightness temperature from the coldest pixels lead to \nbetter height assignments than do others that are based on the contribution function \nexplicitly.    \n12.2.2 Objective \nThe main objective of this study is to derive the water vapor wind vectors over land and sea \nusing multiple half hourly Water Vapor images. The region over which the winds are \nderived should be in the range of 500 from sub-satellite point.  \n12.3 \nInputs \n12.3.1 Static Data  \nParameter \nResolution Source \nContinental \nboundary \ndata \n    4 km \n \nDP (IMD data) \nLand Sea mask 8 km \nWater vapor wind \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n184\n12.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) \n \nParameter \nResolution \nQuantization \nAccuracy \nSource \nRadiometric and \ngeometric corrected \ngray count values of \nWV channel (6.7) \npixel \n10 bit \n-- \nDerived from \nraw data by \nDP (data \nprocessing) \nRadiometric and \ngeometric corrected \ngray count values of \nIR channel (10.5) \npixel \n10 bit \n-- \nDerived from \nraw data by \nDP (data \nprocessing) \nGray value to \nbrightness \ntemperature \nconversion table \n- \n- \n0.3 K \nDerived by \nDP \nGeolocation file \nPixel \n- \n4 km \nDerived by \nDP \n \n \n12.3.3 Other Auxiliary data and Model Inputs \n        \nParameter \n \n \nResolution \n \nAccuracy \n \nSource \n \nNumerical \nmodel forecast \nof wind for all  \nlevels \n \n   \n \n \n \n0.5 degree \n \n \n2 m/s (speed) \n20o (direction) \n \n \n \n \nIMD \nAll levels model \n forecast \ntemperature \n   \n1 K \n12.4  Algorithm Functional Specifications \n12.4.1 Overview \nThe procedure for deriving Water Vapor Wind Vector (WVWV) will be followed the \nbasic methods employed for cloud tracking described in Merrill 1989, 1991 with some \nupgrade in Velden et al. 1997. The vertical distribution of WVWV is dependent on \nseveral key factors: 1) characteristics of the spectral channel, such as central wavelength \nand band width; 2) air-mass characteristics, such as cloudiness and vertical moisture \nprofile; 3) season (less moisture in the cool season leads to lower mean heights); and 4) \nlatitude (higher moisture content and tropopause in the tropics leads to higher mean \nheights). In regard to the first point, the operational geo-stationary weather satellites with \nwater vapor channels (GOES, Meteosat, and GMS) have similar features.  The coverage \nattainable from WVWV is quite uniform in most cases, since the observed displacement \nWater vapor wind \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n185\nof a large portion of the targeted features is a result of pure moisture advection and \nadequately represents the instantaneous wind. The coverage is especially complete in the \nsummertime tropics due to the presence of abundant moisture. However there are \nsituations when extraction of useful WVWV information is difficult, if not impossible. \nThese situations are summarized as: 1) very dry air masses lacking in moisture features, \nwhich prohibits good target selection; 2) regions of strong vertical motion, in which a \ncoherent radiance signal can be significantly attenuated over the tracking interval; 3) \nuniform moisture fields lacking in contrast; 4) strong vertical shear zones, which can be \ndeform targets over the tracking interval; and 5) rapidly amplifying extra-tropical \ntroughs, which contain a large phase speed component. The above conditions represent \nrelatively rare situations when considering full-disk coverage. As a whole the coverage \nand quality of WVWV will vary depending on atmospheric factors such as moisture \navailability and structure, vertical shear, and instrument characteristics such as detector \nprecision and resolution. \n \n12.4.1.1 Methodology \nThe main components for the process of WVWV detection are the following: \n Tracer selection  \n Height assignment \n Tracking \n Wind buffer generation and Quality control \n      \n        Before going to details, a crux of such approaches is given in the following steps: \n The tracer whose displacement is to be detected in subsequent WV image frames \nis selected. \n Let the source image s and target image t is registered to same scale. For every \ngiven m x m (typically 32 x 32 pixels) sub-image cs of the tracer in image s, an n x \nn  (n > m) search window wt is selected in t. The center co-ordinates of cs and wt \nare identical as s and t are registered to the same scale. \n Given cs and wt, the problem of detection of WVWV is to find out best correlation \nmeasure between cs and any one of m x m sub-image within wt. The vector \noriginating from the center co-ordinate of cs to the center of best-matched m x m \nsub-image of wt gives the WVWV.  \n The correlation measures are some sort of similarity measure between time \nvarying sub-images. This similarity measures can be accomplished either by \nmaximum cross-correlation or sum of the squared difference measure or by Nash-\nSutcliffe model efficiency function (Deb et al. 2008). \nWater vapor wind \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n186\n \nFigure 1: The schematic for WVWV detection process \n     The description of each step is given in the following: \n \n  12.4.1.1.1 Tracer selection:  \nAt the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), the initial \ncloud features are selected by locating the highest pixel brightness values for each target \ndomain and computing the local gradients around those locations (Nieman et al., 1997). Any \ngradients greater than 15K are assigned as target locations, and prospective targets also \nundergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter out unwanted \ntargets. Water vapor tracers are generally identified using the local bi-directional gradients in \na template of specified size and compared with empirically determined thresholds to identify \nthe features with sufficient variability (Velden et al., 1997) and those that pass the threshold \nvalue are identified as tracers for cloud-free environments. The pixel with maximum bi-\ndirectional gradient is the location of the tracer. At the European Organization for the \nExploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the tracers in the Meteosat (first-\ngeneration satellites) images are selected using multispectral histogram analysis (Tomassini, \n1981), which extracts the dominating scenes in an image segment corresponding to the area \nof 32 X 32  IR pixels at the sub-satellite point. Later the selected templates undergo a spatial \ncoherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter the image, to enhance the upper-\nlevel cloud. Because the spatial resolution of the water vapor channel of Kalpana-1 (8 km) is \ncoarser relative to GOES (5 km) or Meteosat-7 (5 km), we used a 20 X 20 window (called a \ntemplate) to identify features in Kalpana-1 images. However in case of INSAT-3D (4 km) we \nused 32 x 32 template window. The features are selected by computing local image anomaly \nin a 32 x 32 template window, both in cloudy and cloud free regions. The local image \nanomaly is calculated using the following formula: \n\n\n\ni\nj\nI\nj\ni\nI\na\n)\n,\n(\n                             (1) \nWhere \nj\ni\nI ,\n represent the grey value for (i, j) pixel of a template window and bar represents \nthe mean of grey values within that template. The anomaly-based tracers are generally \nproduced by a smooth feature field in comparison to the gradient-based features. This \ndifference can help in reducing the tracking errors (Deb et al., 2008).  \n \nWater vapor wind \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n187\n12.4.1.1.2 Height assignment  \nThe height assignments of the selected tracers corresponding to each retrieved vectors are \nderived using the following widely used methods viz. the water vapor histogram method \n(HIST) and the H2O intercept method (Nieman et al., 1993). Once final height is selected a \nfew gross error checks are also applied. A brief description of each method is following: \n \na. Water Vapor Histogram Methods (HIST): \nIn this method the height assignment using a single satellite channel is made by comparing \neither infrared window or water vapor brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model \nforecast temperature profiles. Cloud heights are determined by interpolating the cloud \ntemperature, which is an average of coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess \nfield at the target location. A 6-h NWP model forecast from National Center for \nEnvironmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) is the source of \ntemperature profile. This method works well with opaque clouds. However, movement of \nopaque clouds usually does not accurately represent atmospheric motion at the assigned level \n(Nieman et al., 1993), resulting in a lower derived wind speed than observed. \nSemitransparent clouds or sub-pixel clouds give more accurate representation of the actual \nmovement of the atmosphere at a particular level. Estimation of this level is very difficult in \nthese cases since determination of the cloud top BT is affected by an unknown cloud \nemissivity or the percentage of cloud versus clear sky, respectively. The BT values are \nwarmer than observed in these cases, thus leading to estimated cloud heights that are too high \nin pressure (too low in altitude), typically resulting in an overestimation of the wind speed at \nthe estimated cloud height.  \n \nb. Water Vapor−Infrared Window Intercept Method (H2O):  \nHeight assignments derived with this method are based upon the fact that radiances from two \ndifferent spectral bands are linearly related for different cloud amounts within the field of \nview at a specified height. Observed radiance measurements are a function of clear sky and \nopaque cloud radiances.        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nc\nbcd\ncl\nP\nN\nnER\nN\nR\nnE\nN\nR\n,\n1\n\n\n\n               (2)   \nOpaque cloud radiance can be calculated from: \n\n\n\n\n\n\ndp\ndp\np\nT\nN\ndb\nP\nN\nt\nN\nR\nP\nN\nR\ns\nc\np\np\ncl\nc\nbcd\n)\n(\n,\n,\n,\n\n\n\n     (3) \nwhere \nbcd\nR\n is the opaque (\"black\") cloud radiance, Rc1 is the clear sky radiance, t(N,p) is the \nfractional transmittance of radiation of spectral band N emitted from the atmospheric \npressure p arriving at the top of the atmosphere (p=0), n is the fraction of FOV covered with \ncloud, Ps is the surface pressure, Pc is the cloud pressure, and b[N,T(p)] is the Planck \nradiance of the spectral band N for a temperature T(p). The second part of the above equation \nrepresents the radiance decrease from clear sky conditions introduced by an opaque cloud at \na pressure level p. This calculation is dependent upon an \"accurate\" estimation of the current \natmospheric temperature and moisture structure, which are provided by a NWP model \nforecast profile. By comparing the observed radiances with the calculated radiances (for an \nobserved atmosphere defined by the model guess profiles), an estimation of the cloud height \ncan be derived for a completely opaque cloud. In the Fig. 2, observed WV and IR radiances \nat each field of view (FOV) points are plotted with the calculated radiances at different \nWater vapor wind \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n188\nheights for opaque clouds in the atmosphere (curved line). The straight line connects the \ncenter points of the warmest and coldest clusters, which approximate the observed surface \nand cloud conditions.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig 2: Measured radiances (mW m−2 sr−1 cm) for fields of view partially filled with clouds \n(Nieman et al., 1993) \nBy extrapolating this line to intersect the calculated radiance curve, where the cloud amount \nis one (representing an opaque cloud), the cloud top temperature/pressure can be determined. \nThe cluster determination algorithm used is a modified version of the bivariate asymmetric \nGaussian histogram analysis (Rossow et al., 1985; Tomassini, 1981), and involves ten steps. \nThese steps are outlined in detail in Nieman et al., 1993. Calculated water vapor radiances \ncan be in error due to incorrect NWP model forecast profiles. This error would lead to \ncalculated radiances being systematically higher or lower than observed radiances. When the \ncalculated radiances are systematically lower, an adjustment is applied to the radiances \nobtained using the above equation. When the calculated radiances are greater than observed \nradiances, no adjustment is applied since it is assumed that the lower measured radiance is \ndue to cloud contamination. The accuracy of this method can be affected by the amount of \nwater vapor in the atmosphere. Dry atmospheric conditions lead to a steeper slope between \nthe IR and WV radiances, leading to an overestimate in the target height (lower pressure \nvalue). The NCEP GFS model forecast are used here as guess fields. \nOnce the water vapor tracers heights using the above two algorithms have been calculated, \nthe best height among the available heights is determined. The lowest pressure (highest \naltitude) value of all the calculated height values is used as the final pressure height.  \n12.4.1.1.3 Tracking: \nIf a traceable feature is found in the first image and corresponding height of the selected \ntracers are estimated, the match of this template is searched in the second image within a \nbigger ‘‘search window’’, centered at the same point as the template window. To optimize \nthe search window size, the first guess model wind direction at the tracer location is also \nconsidered. The search area is optimized within ±30 degree from the model wind direction at \nthat level of atmosphere. The 32 X 32 template in the second image that lies within the \nsearch window should have the same class as the template in the first image; otherwise the \nWater vapor wind \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n189\ntemplate in the second window is rejected. The cross-correlation technique is used \noperationally for tracking the tracer between two images in most operational centers. \nHowever, in this study the degrees of matching between two successive images are \ncalculated by the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) coefficient (E). \nIt is defined as \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\ni\nt\nt\nn\ni\ns\nt\nI\nI\nI\nI\nE\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n \n \n \n(4) \nWhere \ntI and \nsI  are the variance of the grey values for template window and search window \nand \ntI is the average of variance of template window.  Here n is 32 x 32 and this is the size of \ntemplate window and corresponding template of same size in the searching area. The size of \nthe searching area in the subsequent image is taken as 64 x 64. The coefficient E is \nnormalized to values between – and +1. An efficiency E = 1 corresponds to a perfect match, \nE = 0 means that search window is as accurate as mean of the template window and E < 0 \nimplies the lack of matching between template and search window. The closer the model \nefficiency to 1, the more accurate the matching between the windows. A cut-off value of \nE=0.8 is defined, below which a matching of target is not considered. The Nash-Sutcliffe \nmodel efficiency coefficient (E) is normalized and its value lies between - and 1, towards \nthe higher end (e.g. as E  1.0), the value of E approaches r2, where r is the correlation \ncoefficient. Thus a value of E=1 is exactly equivalent to a correlation of 1.0 between two \nobjects.  The maximum value of E is chosen as the best fit for tracking. One of the main \nadvantages of this matching technique is that it reduces the possibility of multiple maxima, \nbecause the parameter E has a higher sensitivity to differences between two features \ncompared to maximum cross correlation coefficient (MCC). Thus, when the degree of \nmismatch between two objects increases, the value of E falls more sharply compared to that \nof MCC, making E a better index for matching two objects. The application of this tracking \nmethod in estimation of water vapor winds has shown some improvement over Indian Ocean \nregion (Deb et al., 2008).   \n    12.4.1.1.4: Wind buffer generation and Quality control \nQuality indicator of a derived wind vectors is traditionally represented as the degree of the \ncoherence of a given vector with its surrounding. In most of the operational centers the \nAMVs are derived from three successive satellite images and the quality control of the \nretrieved winds are done either through Quality Indicator (Holmlund, 1998) followed at \nEUMETSAT or through 3-dimensional recursive filter function  followed at NESDIS \n(Nieman et al., 1997) or both the algorithms together. In the present study a new technique of \nwind buffer generation and quality control procedure is proposed and implemented first time \nin AMV retrieval. In this technique, a wind buffer is created using previous eight images \nbetween a pair of images (viz. between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored in a \nfile (Fig. 3).  The previous eight images were considered to maintain the minimum 4-hour \ndecorrelation timescale during retrieval (Kaur et al., 2011). In quality control procedure \nconsists of a coherence analysis which forms the basis for acceptance/rejection of a vector \nand degree of coherence computed is used to assign quality flags to the derived vector. The \nvalue of quality flag falls sharply by an exponential function, as the disagreement of a given \nvector with its surroundings increases. Here each vector wind is represented by a complex \nWater vapor wind \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n190\nnumber\nj\ni\nj\ni\nc\nj\ni\nv\ni\nu\nV\n,\n,\n,\n\n\n. For every new vector under consideration, (from current image-\npair), its vector difference from the buffer is computed at the same as well as 3 X 3 \nneighborhood (Fig. 3), provided, the vectors to be compared show similar brightness \ncharacteristics (to maintain the similar height). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig 3: A schematic diagram of quality control process. \n \nHere X (cross sign) at the centre of first box represents the current vector under consideration \nand O (circle sign) represents spatial and temporal neighborhood vectors. The vector \ndifferences (magnitude of complex numbers) are calculated as\n\n\nt\nj\ni\nc\nt\nj\ni\ndif\nV\nV\nV\n,\n,\n,\n,\n\n\n. Here \nc\nV\n represents the current vector at (i, j) point and \nt\nj\ni\nV\n,\n,\n neighborhood vectors with \n1\n1\n,\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nj\ni\n and temporal scale t varies from 1 to 8. If all spatial and temporal \nneighborhood vectors are present, then the difference set will contain 72 vectors (9 spatial \nneighborhoods with 8 temporal scales). However, all vectors may not be there all the times. \nThe quality control process begins if at least 10 vector differences\ndif\nV\n, excluding the \ndifference corresponding to current (i, j), are present in the set. In the next step, set of vector \ndifferences \n\ndif\nV\n is arranged in ascending order. The quality control process begins is the \naverage of 10 \ndif\nV\n is greater than 2.5 m/s. In the next step, the QI value for each vector is \ndetermined by using EUMETSAT procedure where four different tests are performed, which \nis normalized by a tanh-function that returns the value between 0 and 1. A weighted average \nof these individual quality indicators is then used for screening of poor quality vectors from \nfinal output. If any vector is not present in the immediate two pairs, then in-stead of rejecting, \nsearch process goes to the previous time steps of the wind buffer and if still it is not present it \ngoes to next previous times steps and so on. \n If  S is the mean “speed” of a vector computed from two pair of images, then different \nquality functions are computed as below : \n        \nDirection Consistency Function: \n          \n1\n)\n)\n/\nexp(\ntanh(\n0.1\n1\n1\n1\nD\nC\nB\nS\nA\nDCF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWater vapor wind \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n191\n \n            Speed Consistency Function: \n          \n2\n)\n)\n,\n(\ntanh(\n0.1\n2\n2\n2\nD\nC\nB\nS\nA\nMAX\nS\nSCF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n             Vector Consistency Function: \n          \n3\n)\n)\n,\n(\ntanh(\n0.1\n3\n3\n3\nD\nC\nB\nS\nA\nMAX\nV\nVCF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n   Spacial Consistency Function: \n          \n4\n)\n)\n,\n(\ntanh(\n0.1\n2\n4\n4\nD\nm\nC\nB\nS\nA\nMAX\nV\nPCF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n In the above formulation, \nV\nS \n\n\n,\n,\n\nrepresent the difference of direction (degrees), \ndifference of speed, and the length of the difference vector between first and second satellite \nwind component. \nm\nV\n\nis the length of difference vector between satellite wind component \nand its best neighbor. The best neighbor is determined by the smallest vector difference. \nQuantities AN, ,BN, CN, and DN are constants. The final quality indicator of a wind vector is \ngiven as  \n                          QI = \n0.4\nPCF\nVCF\nSCF\nDCF\n\n\n\n \n All the vectors with QI < 0.6 are rejected.  \n \nIn the conventional triplet based methodology requires that a vector is available in both sets \n(i.e. in 1-2 and 2-3), if not so, such vectors are rejected, because they don’t get “support”. \nHundreds of “isolated” vectors thus get eliminated, even though they represent the real \nsituation. In the current method, the vector under consideration receives support from the \npast eight images. This method produces higher number of valid retrieval in the low-level \nand captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. To explain this more explicitly, \nif we take eight satellite images each with 30-minute interval stating at 00:00 UTC to 03:30 \nUTC, then winds retrieved using each-image pair are stored as buffer in a file and \nrepresented as wind buffer generated at 03:30 UTC. The buffer generated at 03:30 UTC is \nused for quality control for wind retrieved using 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images and the \nsecond image time is given as actual observation time of retrieved wind. For example winds \nretrieved using 03:30 UTC wind buffer and 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images is given as \n04:00 UTC observation time. As a whole to complete the process once it requires nine \nimages. Similarly the buffer is updated at every 30-minute with the latest available image and \nprocess is repeated for next cycle of wind retrieval. This method produces higher number of \nvalid retrieval in all levels and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. \nThe height assignment of WVWV is a long-standing problem in this regard. In cloud free \nregions, the radiometric signal from pure water vapor structure is a result of emittance over a \nfinite layer. It is further complicated by radiance contributions from multiple moist layer \n(Weldon and Holmes 1991). Here the challenge is to assign a height that best represents the \nmotion of the feature. In the first step, the instrument measured radiances is converted into \nbrightness temperature, which requires an accurate definition of the spectral response of the \nWater vapor wind \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n192\ninstrument. It is important to note that the different instruments are sensing radiation from \nslightly different parts of the H2O absorption band. Sampling the center of the absorption \nband (around 6.3µm) yields radiation from upper levels of the troposphere. Sampling away \nfrom the center of the absorption band yields radiation from lower levels of the troposphere. \n \nOnce the target is selected for tracking, the brightness temperature in the target area is \naveraged and this value will be matched with a collocated model guess temperature profile. \nThe level of optimum fit will be used to assign an initial pressure height. \n \n12.4.2 Operational Implementation \n \n1.4.2.1 Step 1 : Conversion from gray count to BT \n In this step a radiation model will be used to convert the instrument measured \nradiances into brightness temperature. This requires an accurate definition of the \nspectral response of the satellite.  \n It is important that the different instruments are sensing radiation from slightly \ndifferent parts of H2O absorption band. Sampling the centre of the absorption \nband yields radiation from the upper levels of the troposphere, similarly sampling \naway from the centre of the absorption band yields radiation from lower levels of \nthe atmosphere \n   \n   12.4.2.2   Step 2: Tracer selection from image \n Water-vapor images tracer selection will be done by evaluating local image \nanomaly surrounding each pixel in the target array and selecting the maximum \nbrightness temperature of the window exceeding some thresholds value. \n \n12.4.2.3  Step 3: Height assignment \n Assign height of the selected tracer using water vapor histogram technique. In \nthis case the brightness temperature in the target window will be averaged and \nmatched with collocated numerical model temperature profile. The level of \noptimum fit will be assigned as initial height. \n Re-assign the height using H2O intercept technique for semi-transparent tracers. \n Assign correct height after implementing all the height assignment technique \nmentioned above. \n \n12.4.2.4 Step 4: Tracking \n The tracking employs a simple search for the minimum in the sum of squares of \nthe radiance difference between the target and search arrays in subsequent half \nhourly images. This search will be done in the direction of   30o of model wind. \n \n12.4.2.5  Step 5: Wind buffer generation & quality control \n The wind buffer is created using previous eight images between pairs of images \n(viz. the winds retrieved between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored \nin a file.  The selection of eight images is consistent with decorrelation \ntimescales of winds over tropical region. \n Use quality control criteria for selecting wind using the wind buffer. \n Again calculate wind speed and direction.   \nWater vapor wind \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n193\n12.5 \nOutputs \nParameter \nUnit \nMin \nMax \nAccuracy \nResolution \n \nU and V component of WVWV \n \n \nm/sec \n \n0 \n \n70 \n \n5 -6 m/s \n \n0.5 – 2.5 deg \nDomain of output : 30oE – 130oE :: 50o S – 50o N \n \n12.5.1 Format of the output and the domain \n     As output of WVWV the following parameters will be provided to IMD:  \n Zonal and meridional components of the wind vectors. \n Latitudinal and longitudinal position.  \n Height of WVWV \n \nThe format of the final product will be like this: \n   \n12.6  Validation \n   12.6.1 Data required \nParameter \n \nType \nSource \nWind \nCollocated Rawinsonde \nIMD \n   12.6.2 Methods of validation  \nThe evaluation of WVWV should be taken into both qualitative and quantitative measures.  \nQuantitative assessment of the WVWV product is possible from statistical analyses and \nimpact on NWP.

These statistics can provide a fixed measure of \nproduct quality over time and can be employed in determining observation weight in \nobjective data assimilation.

Assuming \nthe registration has an error of 1 pixel then error of the final product will be of 5 m/sec. \nHowever the following limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind. The spatially \ncoherent, high-resolution coverage of upper tropospheric winds are possible from geo-\nstationary satellite remote sensing of water vapor. WVWV are comparable in quality to \noperational upper-level cloud-motion vectors. However, the retrieved vectors in regions are \nlacking in defining moisture structure, though they have the ability to obtain track-able \ninformation in extremely dry air masses and regions of strong subsidence is limited. The \nindividual vectors represent single level reports; however, upper level vertical winds profiles \nare possible by using multi-spectral observations. \n   \n 12.8   References \n1.

The INSAT-3D will have \none visible channel (0.55 – 0.75 (m). In this document some background and general \ncharacteristic of satellite-derived winds from visible channels and INSAT-3D visible \nchannel characteristics; the methodology employed to derive the vector fields, theoretical \nbasis and practical aspects of this algorithm and outlined the planned validation approach. \n \n 13.2.1 Overview and background  \n  \nSpatio–temporal analysis of meteorological events is an important part of routine numerical \nweather analysis. In that context, a cloud tracking method is presented here for a sequence of \ngeostationary satellite images. Given a pair of remotely sensed images, captured at a fixed \ntime interval (typically, 30 min), the objective is to derive motion vectors associated with the \ncloud mass. This correspondence process is a useful precursor to cloud motion vector studies \nand spatio–temporal analysis of cloud life cycles. The spatio–temporal life cycle includes the \ngeneration, dissipation and assimilation of clouds that can be observed in a sequence of \ngeostationary satellite images. During the 1970’s and early 1980’s, cloud motion winds were \nproduced in major operational centers like NESDIS (National Environmental Satellite Data \nand Information Service) using a combination of automated and manual techniques. Early \nautomated techniques supplied quality low-level vectors from visible channels but often \nyielded in consistent quality for mid- and high-level motions. Height assignment for the \nvisible winds is done with collocated infrared images using infrared window technique. In \nthe subsequent years, due to the developments in image-processing and pattern recognition \ntechniques (Merill et al., 1991), it was possible to design fully automatic techniques for wind \nretrieval, and NESDIS began its application in 1992. In later time, several new developments \nwere made to make accurate retrievals of winds from satellite images.   \nVisible wind vectors \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n202\n13.2.2 Objective \nThe main objective of this study is to derive the Visible Winds (VIS) over sea using multiple \nsuccessive half hourly VIS images.

Any \ngradients greater than 150K are assigned as target locations, and prospective targets also \nundergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter out unwanted \ntargets. Water vapor tracers are generally identified using the local bi-directional gradients in \na template of specified size and compared with empirically determined thresholds to identify \nthe features with sufficient variability (Velden et al., 1997) and those that pass the threshold \nvalue are identified as tracers for cloud-free environments. The pixel with maximum bi-\ndirectional gradient is the location of the tracer. At the European Organization for the \nExploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the tracers in the Meteosat (first-\ngeneration satellites) images are selected using multispectral histogram analysis (Tomassini, \n1981), which extracts the dominating scenes in an image segment. Later the selected \ntemplates undergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter the \nimage, to enhance the upper-level cloud. In the present study the features are selected by \ncomputing local image anomaly in a 32 x 32 template window, both in cloudy regions of the \nvisible images. The local image anomaly is calculated using the following formula: \n   \n\n\n\ni\nj\nI\nj\ni\nI\na\n)\n,\n(\n                             (1) \nWhere \nj\ni\nI ,\n represent the grey value for (i, j) pixel of a template window and bar represents \nthe mean of grey values within that template. The anomaly-based tracers are generally \nproduced by a smooth feature field in comparison to the gradient-based features. This \ndifference can help in reducing the tracking errors (Deb et al., 2008). \n \n13.4.1.1.2 Height assignment \nThe height assignments of the selected tracers selected based on the above criterion are \nderived using the collocated infrared images with the following widely used methods viz. \nsuch as the infrared window (WIN) technique and the cloud base method (LeMarshall, 1993). \nOnce final height is selected a few gross error checks are also applied. A brief description of \neach method is following: \n \n2.4 Infrared Window Channel (WIN): \nIn this method the height assignment using a single satellite channel is made by comparing \neither infrared window brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model forecast \ntemperature profiles. Cloud heights are determined by interpolating the cloud temperature, \nwhich is an average of coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess field at the \ntarget location. A 6-h NWP model forecast from National Center for Environmental \nPrediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) is the source of temperature profile. This \nmethod works well with opaque clouds. However, movement of opaque clouds usually does \nnot accurately represent atmospheric motion at the assigned level (Nieman et al., 1993), \nresulting in a lower derived wind speed than observed.  \n2.5 Cloud Base Method (BASE): \nVisible wind vectors \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n204\nWind speeds for low-level cumulus clouds (cloud top pressures greater than 600 hPa or \naltitudes lower than 600 hPa) have been found to be best represented by the movement at the \ncloud base level instead of the mid or upper levels of the cloud (Hasler et al., 1979). A \nmethod was developed at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (LeMarshall, 1993) to \nestimate this height using the Infrared Window channel. This method first constructs a \nhistogram of the BT values over a selected region surrounding the cloud target being \nexamined. This histogram is then smoothed and Hermite polynomials are fitted to the \nhistogram to separate the distribution into two components; a cloudy and clear sky region. \nAssuming the distributions are normal, the cloud base height can be estimated. The mid \ncloud temperature is determined by examining the second derivative histogram of the cloudy \ndistribution, while the cloud top temperature is estimated to be located at the coldest 5% of \nthe cloudy distribution. The cloud base temperature is estimated to be located the same \ndistance from the mid cloud temperature as the cloud top temperature. The calculated cloud \nbase temperature is converted to a pressure using model field interpolated to the target \nlocation. As mentioned previously, this height assignment method is only applied to those \ntargets which are calculated to have a cloud top pressure of greater than 600 hPa (i.e. altitude \nlower than 600 hPa). This \"initial\" target cloud top height is provided by one of the previous \nInfrared Window height assignment methods. The BASE method is used to adjust only these \nwinds, and is not utilized for water vapor winds or winds with pressures less than 600 hPa \n(i.e. altitudes higher than 600 hPa).  \n \nOnce the visible tracers heights using the above two algorithms have been calculated, the \nbest height among the available heights is determined. The lowest pressure (highest altitude) \nvalue of all the calculated height values is used as the final pressure height. However, if for a \nspecific visible tracer final height is WIN and a valid BASE height is available, then the \nBASE height is used as the final height. \n    \n 13.4.1.1.3 Tracking \nIf a traceable feature is found in the first image and corresponding height of the selected \ntracers are estimated, the match of this template is searched in the second image within a \nbigger ‘‘search window’’, centered at the same point as the template window. To optimize \nthe search window size, the first guess model wind direction at the tracer location is also \nconsidered. The search area is optimized within ±30 degree from the model wind direction at \nthat level of atmosphere. The 32 X 32 template in the second image that lies within the \nsearch window should have the same class as the template in the first image; otherwise the \ntemplate in the second window is rejected. The cross-correlation technique is used \noperationally for tracking the tracer between two images in most operational centers. \nHowever, in this study the degrees of matching between two successive images are \ncalculated by the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) coefficient (E). \nIt is defined as \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\ni\nt\nt\nn\ni\ns\nt\nI\nI\nI\nI\nE\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n \n \n \n(2) \nVisible wind vectors \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n205\nWhere \ntI and \nsI  are the variance of the grey values for template window and search window \nand \ntI is the average of variance of template window.  Here n is 32 x 32 and this is the size of \ntemplate window and corresponding template of same size in the searching area. The size of \nthe searching area in the subsequent image is taken as 64 x 64. The coefficient E is \nnormalized to values between – and +1. An efficiency E = 1 corresponds to a perfect match, \nE = 0 means that search window is as accurate as mean of the template window and E < 0 \nimplies the lack of matching between template and search window. The closer the model \nefficiency to 1, the more accurate the matching between the windows. A cut-off value of \nE=0.8 is defined, below which a matching of target is not considered. The Nash-Sutcliffe \nmodel efficiency coefficient (E) is normalized and its value lies between - and 1, towards \nthe higher end (e.g. as E  1.0), the value of E approaches r2, where r is the correlation \ncoefficient. Thus a value of E=1 is exactly equivalent to a correlation of 1.0 between two \nobjects.  The maximum value of E is chosen as the best fit for tracking. One of the main \nadvantages of this matching technique is that it reduces the possibility of multiple maxima, \nbecause the parameter E has a higher sensitivity to differences between two features \ncompared to maximum cross correlation coefficient (MCC). Thus, when the degree of \nmismatch between two objects increases, the value of E falls more sharply compared to that \nof MCC, making E a better index for matching two objects. The application of this tracking \nmethod in estimation of water vapor winds has shown some improvement over Indian Ocean \nregion (Deb et al., 2008).   \n \n \n13.4.1.1.4: Wind buffer generation and Quality control \nQuality indicator of a derived wind vectors is traditionally represented as the degree of the \ncoherence of a given vector with its surrounding. In most of the operational centers the \nAMVs are derived from three successive satellite images and the quality control of the \nretrieved winds are done either through Quality Indicator (QI) (Holmlund, 1998) followed at \nEUMETSAT or through 3-dimensional recursive filter function  followed at NESDIS \n(Nieman et al., 1997) or both the algorithms together. In the present study a new technique of \nwind buffer generation and subsequently QI procedure followed at EUMETSAT is proposed. \nIn this technique, a wind buffer is created using previous eight images between a pair of \nimages (viz. between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored in a file (Fig. 1).  The \nprevious eight images were considered to maintain the minimum 4-hour decorrelation \ntimescale during retrieval (Kaur et al., 2011). In quality control procedure consists of a \ncoherence analysis which forms the basis for acceptance/rejection of a vector and degree of \ncoherence computed is used to assign quality flags to the derived vector. The value of quality \nflag falls sharply by an exponential function, as the disagreement of a given vector with its \nsurroundings increases. Here each vector wind is represented by a complex \nnumber\nj\ni\nj\ni\nc\nj\ni\nv\ni\nu\nV\n,\n,\n,\n\n\n. For every new vector under consideration, (from current image-\npair), its vector difference from the buffer is computed at the same as well as 3 X 3 \nneighborhood (Fig. 1), provided, the vectors to be compared show similar brightness \ncharacteristics (to maintain the similar height). \nVisible wind vectors \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n206\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig 1: A schematic diagram of quality control process. \n \nHere X (cross sign) at the centre of first box represents the current vector under consideration \nand O (circle sign) represents spatial and temporal neighborhood vectors.

If all spatial and temporal \nneighborhood vectors are present, then the difference set will contain 72 vectors (9 spatial \nneighborhoods with 8 temporal scales). However, all vectors may not be there all the times. \nThe quality control process begins if at least 10 vector differences\ndif\nV\n, excluding the \ndifference corresponding to current (i, j), are present in the set. In the next step, set of vector \ndifferences \n\ndif\nV\n is arranged in ascending order. The quality control process begins is the \naverage of 10 \ndif\nV\n is greater than 2.5 m/s. In the next step, the QI value for each vector is \ndetermined by using EUMETSAT procedure where four different tests are performed, which \nis normalized by a tanh-function that returns the value between 0 and 1. A weighted average \nof these individual quality indicators is then used for screening of poor quality vectors from \nfinal output. If any vector is not present in the immediate two pairs, then in-stead of rejecting, \nsearch process goes to the previous time steps of the wind buffer and if still it is not present it \ngoes to next previous times steps and so on. \n If  S is the mean “speed” of a vector computed from two pair of images, then different \nquality functions are computed as below : \n       Direction Consistency Function: \n          \n1\n)\n)\n/\nexp(\ntanh(\n0.1\n1\n1\n1\nD\nC\nB\nS\nA\nDCF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n     Speed Consistency Function: \n          \n2\n)\n)\n,\n(\ntanh(\n0.1\n2\n2\n2\nD\nC\nB\nS\nA\nMAX\nS\nSCF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n         \nVisible wind vectors \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n207\n     Vector Consistency Function: \n          \n3\n)\n)\n,\n(\ntanh(\n0.1\n3\n3\n3\nD\nC\nB\nS\nA\nMAX\nV\nVCF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n   Spacial Consistency Function: \n          \n4\n)\n)\n,\n(\ntanh(\n0.1\n2\n4\n4\nD\nm\nC\nB\nS\nA\nMAX\nV\nPCF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn the above formulation, \nV\nS \n\n\n,\n,\n\nrepresent the difference of direction (degrees), \ndifference of speed, and the length of the difference vector between first and second satellite \nwind component. \nm\nV\n\nis the length of difference vector between satellite wind component \nand its best neighbor. The best neighbor is determined by the smallest vector difference. \nQuantities AN,BN,CN, and DN are constants. The final quality indicator of a wind vector is \ngiven as  \n                          QI = \n0.4\nPCF\nVCF\nSCF\nDCF\n\n\n\n \n        All the vectors with QI < 0.6 are rejected.  \nIn the conventional triplet based methodology requires that a vector is available in both sets \n(i.e. in 1-2 and 2-3), if not so, such vectors are rejected, because they don’t get “support”. \nHundreds of “isolated” vectors thus get eliminated, even though they represent the real \nsituation. In the current method, the vector under consideration receives support from the \npast eight images. This method produces higher number of valid retrieval in the low-level \nand captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. To explain this more explicitly, \nif we take eight satellite images each with 30-minute interval stating at 00:00 UTC to 03:30 \nUTC, then winds retrieved using each-image pair are stored as buffer in a file and \nrepresented as wind buffer generated at 03:30 UTC. The buffer generated at 03:30 UTC is \nused for quality control for wind retrieved using 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images and the \nsecond image time is given as actual observation time of retrieved wind. For example winds \nretrieved using 03:30 UTC wind buffer and 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images is given as \n04:00 UTC observation time. As a whole to complete the process once it requires nine \nimages. Similarly the buffer is updated at every 30-minute with the latest available image and \nprocess is repeated for next cycle of wind retrieval. This method produces higher number of \nvalid retrieval in all levels and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. \n \n13.4.2 Operational Implementation \n \n13.4.2.1 Step 1: Tracer selection from image \n Cloud tracer selection will be done by evaluating the local image anomaly \nsurrounding each pixel in the target array and selecting the maximum brightness \ntemperature of the window.    \n \n13.4.2.2 Step 2: Height assignment \n Assign height of the selected tracer using IR window technique. In this case the \nbrightness temperature in the target window will be averaged and matched with \ncollocated numerical model temperature profile. The level of optimum fit will \nbe assigned as initial height. \nVisible wind vectors \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n208\n Re-assign the height using cloud-base height assignment technique. \n Assign correct height after implementing all the height assignment technique \nmentioned above. \n \n13.4.2.3 Step 3: Tracking \n The tracking employs a simple search for the mean absolute difference of the \nradiance difference between the target and search arrays in subsequent half \nhourly images. This search will be done in the direction of   30o of model wind. \n \n13.4.2.4 Step 4: Wind buffer generation & quality control \n The wind buffer is created using previous eight images between pairs of images \n(viz. the winds retrieved between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored \nin a file.  The selection of eight images is consistent with decorrelation \ntimescales of winds over tropical region. \n Use quality control criteria for selecting wind using the wind buffer. \n Calculate wind speed and direction.   \n13.5  Outputs \nParameter \n \nUnit \nMin \nMax \nAccuracy \nResolution \nU and V component \nof CMV \n \n \nm/sec \n \n0 \n \n90 \n5-6 m/sec (upper level) \n4-5 m/sec (lower level)  \n \n-- \nDomain of output : 30oE – 130oE :: 50o S – 50o N \n \n   13.5.1 Format of the output and the domain \n       As output of VIS wind the following parameters will be provided to IMD:  \n Zonal and meridional components of the wind vectors. \n Latitudinal and longitudinal position.  \n Height of wind \n      The format of the final product will be like this: \n \n13.6  Validation \n \n   13.6.1 Data required \n \nParameter \nType \nSource \nWind \nCollocated Radiosonde Profiles \nIMD \nParameter Lat.

Quantitative assessment of the VIS winds product is possible from statistical \nanalyses and impact on NWP. The traditional method of validation is matching \nobservations with collocated radiosondes. The statistical validation will be done according \nto the CGMS winds evaluation reporting guidelines. These statistics can provide a fixed \nmeasure of product quality over time and can be employed in determining observation \nweight in objective data assimilation.  At the CGMS XXIII the Working Group on \nSatellite Tracked Winds recommended that evaluation of operational wind production \nquality should be accomplished with a new standardized reporting method.

The standard accuracy \naccording to CGMS guideline for CMV is that the root mean square error (RMSE) for \nWV winds should be 7m/s respectively with respect to radiosonde observations.  The \nmean bias for both sets of winds should be about zero. \n13.7  Technical Issues (Limitations etc) \nAccuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the registration of the images. If \nthe registration has an error of 1 pixel, then error of the final product will be increased. \nHowever the following limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind. The \nspatially coherent, high resolution coverage of upper tropospheric winds are possible \nfrom geostationary satellite remote sensing of water vapor. VIS wind are comparable in \nquality to operational upper-level cloud-motion vectors. However, the retrieved vectors \nin regions are lacking in defining moisture structure, though they have the ability to \nobtain track-able information in extremely dry air masses and regions of strong \nsubsidence is limited. The individual vectors represent single level reports; however, \nupper level vertical winds profiles are possible by using multi-spectral observations. \n   \n1. \nSensitivity of error in height assignment to the error in wind speed \nretrieval \nThis sensitivity will depend upon the structure of wind circulation over different \nvertical levels as well as different geographical regions. For example, in the vicinity \nof atmospheric jets, the retrieved wind vectors will be highly sensitive to the errors in \nthe assigned pressure levels. Based on some standard analysis (e.g. NCEP reanalysis \nof 6-hourly sampling), we will provide a quantitative assessment of the vertical and \nspatial structure of this sensitivity. \n \n2. \nNumerical model to be used for AMV height assignment \nWe plan to use IMD’s operational regional model output during height assignment \nprocedure. However, if the domain of this regional model is smaller than the area of \nAMV retrieval, either IMD may be requested to increase the domain of its operational \nmodel, or a lower-quality solution based on the output of coarser-resolution GCM \nwill be generated over the regions not covered by IMD’s regional model. \n \n3. Whether RT model to be used in real-time for height assignment   \nTo use RT model in real-time height-assignment application is generally required to \nfind the optimum solution. However, it is computationally expensive and may \nincrease the AMV turn-around time very significantly. Efforts are currently underway \nto develop an empirical version of RT model that can be used for simulation of IR \n    N \n(∆U2)  =  ∑ (Ui –Ur)2   \n              i=1 \n              N \n(∆V2)  =  ∑ (Vi –Vr)2   \n              i=1 \n(MCD) =   [ (∆U2)  + (∆V2)  ]1/2  ≠ (MVD) \nVisible wind vectors \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n211\nand water-vapor channel radiances for a variety of cloud heights. The inverse of this \nempirical model will then be used in real-time applications.  \n \n4. \nComparison of maximum-correlation and minimum-difference methods \nfor tracking of cloud-tracers. \nThe comparison have been made for a large number of image samples and it was \nfound that the efficiencies of minimum-difference method (MDM) and maximum \ncross correlation (MCC) methods are comparable, while the MDM method is \nsignificantly faster than MCC.    \n13.8   References \n \n \n1.

The \nINSAT-3D will have one MIR channel (3.8 – 4.0 m). In this document some background \nand general characteristic of satellite-derived winds from mid-infrared channels \ncharacteristics; the methodology employed to derive the vector fields, theoretical basis and \npractical aspects of this algorithm and outlined the planned validation approach. \n   \n14.2.1 Overview and background  \n  \nSpatio–temporal analysis of meteorological events is an important part of routine numerical \nweather analysis. In that context, a cloud tracking method is presented here for a sequence of \ngeostationary satellite images. Given a pair of remotely sensed images, captured at a fixed \ntime interval (typically, 30 min), the objective is to derive motion vectors associated with the \ncloud mass. This correspondence process is a useful precursor to cloud motion vector studies \nand spatio–temporal analysis of cloud life cycles. The spatio–temporal life cycle includes the \ngeneration, dissipation and assimilation of clouds that can be observed in a sequence of \ngeostationary satellite images. During the 1970’s and early 1980’s, cloud motion winds were \nproduced in major operational centers like NESDIS (National Environmental Satellite Data \nand Information Service) using a combination of automated and manual techniques. Early \nautomated techniques supplied quality low-level vectors from mid-infrared channel but often \nyielded in consistent quality for mid- and high-level motions. Height assignment for the mid-\ninfrared winds is done with collocated infrared images using infrared window technique. In \nthe subsequent years, due to the developments in image-processing and pattern recognition \ntechniques (Merill et al., 1991), it was possible to design fully automatic techniques for wind \nretrieval, and NESDIS began its application in 1992. In later time, several new developments \nwere made to make accurate retrievals of winds from satellite images.   \nGenerally, atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) wind coverage has been diurnally consistent \nin the mid to upper-levels (100-600 hPa) by the use of 6.7 μm water vapor and 10.7 μm long-\nMid infra-red wind vectors \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n216\nwave infrared (LWIR) channels. However, in the low-levels (600-950 hPa), AMVs are \nretrieved using a combination of the visible and LWIR channels, depending on the time of \nday. The visible channel provides far superior low-level tracer detection than the LWIR \nchannel. This is due to its finer spatial resolution and decreased susceptibility to attenuation \nby low-level moisture. Unfortunately, nighttime low-level satellite wind coverage typically \ndecreases sharply when visible channel is not available. This creates a situation of overall \nreduced wind information for the user during night-time. Using the mid-infrared (MIR) 3.9 \nμm channel on the INSAT-3D satellite, MIR cloud-drift winds have been developed to \nprovide improved nighttime low-level satellite wind coverage. The MIR channel is slightly \nmore sensitive to warmer temperatures and less sensitive to thin cirrus than the 10.7 μm long-\nwave infrared (LWIR) channel traditionally used to track low-level clouds at night. This \nallows for a higher detectability rate of low-level (600-950 hPa) cloud tracers in the MIR \nchannel. Improved low-level nighttime wind coverage can provide forecasters with more \nwind data as well as reduce the diurnal inconsistencies that may be a challenge to data \nassimilation into models. \n14.2.2 Objective \nThe main objective of this study is to derive the Mid-Infrared Winds (MIR) over sea using \nmultiple successive half hourly MIR images. The region over which the winds are derived \nshould be in the range of 500 from sub-satellite point.  \n14.3 \nInputs \n14.3.1 Static Data  \n \nParameter \nResolution Source \nContinental boundary Data \n  1 km \nDP (IMD data) \n \n14.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) \nParameter \nResolution \nQuantization \nAccuracy \nSource \nRadiometric and geometric \ncorrected gray count \nvalues of  split window IR \nchannel (10.5-11.5 m and \n11.5-12.5 m) and MIR \nchannel (3.9 m) \n \n(All the data is required in \nfixed lat-lon grid for \ncontinuous 8-images \nseparated by 30 minutes \ntime interval) \npixel \n10 bit \n-- \nDerived \nfrom raw \ndata by DP \n(data \nprocessing) \nGray value to brightness \ntemperature conversion \ntable \n- \n- \n0.3 K \nDerived by \nDP \nGeo-location file \nPixel \n- \n1 Km \nDerived by \nDP \nMid infra-red wind vectors \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n217\n14.3.3 Other Auxiliary data and Model Inputs \n \n    Parameter \nResolution \nAccuracy \nSource \nNumerical model forecast \nof wind for all levels \n   \n \n1 degree or 0.5 \ndegree \n \n2 m/s \n(speed) \n20o \n(direction) \n \n \n           IMD \nAll levels model forecast \nTemperature \n   \n1o K \n14.4 \nAlgorithm Functional Specifications \n14.4.1 Overview \n14.4.1.1 Methodology \n     14.4.1.1.1 Solar Contamination in MIR Channel \nThe MIIR channel is susceptible to solar contamination during daytime due to its proximity \nto the visible spectrum. Cirrus clouds are somewhat reflective of solar radiation and cumulus \nclouds are highly reflective in the MIR channel. Since low-level cumulus clouds are the main \nsource of targets for low-level cloud-drift winds, this reflectance causes tracking problems \ndue to saturation effects. The reflected solar energy received at the INSAT-3D sensor from \nthe cumulus clouds can make them appear to be warmer than even the underlying ocean \nsurface at times. This makes tracer selection extremely difficult and erroneous. Therefore, the \nusefulness of this channel for winds derivation to be limited to nighttime applications \nbecause of its sensitivity to solar contamination.  \n \n   14.4.1.1.2 MIR Image Enhancements \nThe MIR channel is characterized by relatively small gradients in brightness temperatures in \nthe warmer low levels. This limits the ability of the tracking algorithm to detect viable cloud \ntargets and resultant tracers over time. A technique was developed at CIMSS (Velden and \nDunion 2001) to enhance the MIR imagery by stretching the brightness temperature contrast \nin the warmer end of the spectrum (low levels). Specifically, the brightness temperature \nrange from 50-160 is stretched. This enhancement greatly improves the gradients in the low-\nlevels at the cost of confining the mid to upper-level gradients in the image. Therefore, tracer \ndetection is strictly limited to cloud tracers ≥600 hPa (based on brightness temperature \ndetermined heights). The image enhancement technique is performed on the MIR images \nused to track the cloud features.  \n   14.4.1.1.3 Tracer selection  \nAt the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), the initial \ncloud features are selected by locating the highest pixel brightness values for each target \ndomain and computing the local gradients around those locations (Nieman et al., 1997). Any \ngradients greater than 150K are assigned as target locations, and prospective targets also \nundergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter out unwanted \ntargets. Water vapor tracers are generally identified using the local bi-directional gradients in \na template of specified size and compared with empirically determined thresholds to identify \nMid infra-red wind vectors \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n218\nthe features with sufficient variability (Velden et al., 1997) and those that pass the threshold \nvalue are identified as tracers for cloud-free environments. The pixel with maximum bi-\ndirectional gradient is the location of the tracer. At the European Organization for the \nExploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the tracers in the Meteosat (first-\ngeneration satellites) images are selected using multispectral histogram analysis (Tomassini, \n1981), which extracts the dominating scenes in an image segment. Later the selected \ntemplates undergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter the \nimage, to enhance the upper-level cloud. In the present study the features are selected by \ncomputing local image anomaly in a 32 x 32 template window, both in cloudy regions of the \nmid-infrared images. The local image anomaly is calculated using the following formula: \n   \n\n\n\ni\nj\nI\nj\ni\nI\na\n)\n,\n(\n                             (1) \nWhere \nj\ni\nI ,\n represent the grey value for (i, j) pixel of a template window and bar represents \nthe mean of grey values within that template. The anomaly-based tracers are generally \nproduced by a smooth feature field in comparison to the gradient-based features. This \ndifference can help in reducing the tracking errors (Deb et al., 2008). \n \n14.4.1.1.4 Height assignment \nThe height assignments of the selected tracers selected based on the above criterion are \nderived using the collocated infrared images with the following widely used methods viz. \nsuch as the infrared window (WIN) technique and the cloud base method (LeMarshall, 1993). \nOnce final height is selected a few gross error checks are also applied. A brief description of \neach method is following: \n \nInfrared Window Channel (WIN): \nIn this method the height assignment using a single satellite channel is made by comparing \neither infrared window brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model forecast \ntemperature profiles. Cloud heights are determined by interpolating the cloud temperature, \nwhich is an average of coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess field at the \ntarget location. A 6-h NWP model forecast from National Center for Environmental \nPrediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) is the source of temperature profile. This \nmethod works well with opaque clouds. However, movement of opaque clouds usually does \nnot accurately represent atmospheric motion at the assigned level (Nieman et al., 1993), \nresulting in a lower derived wind speed than observed.  \n \nCloud Base Method (BASE): \nWind speeds for low-level cumulus clouds (cloud top pressures greater than 600 hPa or \naltitudes lower than 600 hPa) have been found to be best represented by the movement at the \ncloud base level instead of the mid or upper levels of the cloud (Hasler et al., 1979). A \nmethod was developed at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (LeMarshall, 1993) to \nestimate this height using the Infrared Window channel. This method first constructs a \nhistogram of the BT values over a selected region surrounding the cloud target being \nexamined. This histogram is then smoothed and Hermite polynomials are fitted to the \nhistogram to separate the distribution into two components; a cloudy and clear sky region. \nAssuming the distributions are normal, the cloud base height can be estimated. The mid \ncloud temperature is determined by examining the second derivative histogram of the cloudy \nMid infra-red wind vectors \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n219\ndistribution, while the cloud top temperature is estimated to be located at the coldest 5% of \nthe cloudy distribution. The cloud base temperature is estimated to be located the same \ndistance from the mid cloud temperature as the cloud top temperature. The calculated cloud \nbase temperature is converted to a pressure using model field interpolated to the target \nlocation. As mentioned previously, this height assignment method is only applied to those \ntargets which are calculated to have a cloud top pressure of greater than 600 hPa (i.e. altitude \nlower than 600 hPa). This \"initial\" target cloud top height is provided by one of the previous \nInfrared Window height assignment methods. The BASE method is used to adjust only these \nwinds, and is not utilized for water vapor winds or winds with pressures less than 600 hPa \n(i.e. altitudes higher than 600 hPa).  \n \nOnce the mid-infrared tracers heights using the above two algorithms have been calculated, \nthe best height among the available heights is determined. The lowest pressure (highest \naltitude) value of all the calculated height values is used as the final pressure height. \nHowever, if for a specific tracer final height is WIN and a valid BASE height is available, \nthen the BASE height is used as the final height. \n    \n 14.4.1.1.5 Tracking \nIf a traceable feature is found in the first image and corresponding height of the selected \ntracers are estimated, the match of this template is searched in the second image within a \nbigger ‘‘search window’’, centered at the same point as the template window. To optimize \nthe search window size, the first guess model wind direction at the tracer location is also \nconsidered. The search area is optimized within ±30 degree from the model wind direction at \nthat level of atmosphere. The 32 X 32 template in the second image that lies within the \nsearch window should have the same class as the template in the first image; otherwise the \ntemplate in the second window is rejected. The cross-correlation technique is used \noperationally for tracking the tracer between two images in most operational centers. \nHowever, in this study the degrees of matching between two successive images are \ncalculated by the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) coefficient (E). \nIt is defined as \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\ni\nt\nt\nn\ni\ns\nt\nI\nI\nI\nI\nE\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n \n \n \n(2) \nWhere \ntI and \nsI  are the variance of the grey values for template window and search window \nand \ntI is the average of variance of template window.  Here n is 32 x 32 and this is the size of \ntemplate window and corresponding template of same size in the searching area. The size of \nthe searching area in the subsequent image is taken as 64 x 64. The coefficient E is \nnormalized to values between – and +1. An efficiency E = 1 corresponds to a perfect match, \nE = 0 means that search window is as accurate as mean of the template window and E < 0 \nimplies the lack of matching between template and search window. The closer the model \nefficiency to 1, the more accurate the matching between the windows. A cut-off value of \nE=0.8 is defined, below which a matching of target is not considered. The Nash-Sutcliffe \nmodel efficiency coefficient (E) is normalized and its value lies between - and 1, towards \nthe higher end (e.g. as E  1.0), the value of E approaches r2, where r is the correlation \nMid infra-red wind vectors \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n220\ncoefficient. Thus a value of E=1 is exactly equivalent to a correlation of 1.0 between two \nobjects.  The maximum value of E is chosen as the best fit for tracking. One of the main \nadvantages of this matching technique is that it reduces the possibility of multiple maxima, \nbecause the parameter E has a higher sensitivity to differences between two features \ncompared to maximum cross correlation coefficient (MCC). Thus, when the degree of \nmismatch between two objects increases, the value of E falls more sharply compared to that \nof MCC, making E a better index for matching two objects. The application of this tracking \nmethod in estimation of water vapor winds has shown some improvement over Indian Ocean \nregion (Deb et al., 2008).   \n \n \n14.4.1.1.6 Wind buffer generation and Quality control \nQuality indicator of a derived wind vectors is traditionally represented as the degree of the \ncoherence of a given vector with its surrounding. In most of the operational centers the \nAMVs are derived from three successive satellite images and the quality control of the \nretrieved winds are done either through Quality Indicator (QI) (Holmlund, 1998) followed at \nEUMETSAT or through 3-dimensional recursive filter function  followed at NESDIS \n(Nieman et al., 1997) or both the algorithms together. In the present study a new technique of \nwind buffer generation and subsequently QI procedure followed at EUMETSAT is proposed. \nIn this technique, a wind buffer is created using previous eight images between a pair of \nimages (viz. between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored in a file (Fig. 1).  The \nprevious eight images were considered to maintain the minimum 4-hour decorrelation \ntimescale during retrieval (Kaur et al., 2011). In quality control procedure consists of a \ncoherence analysis which forms the basis for acceptance/rejection of a vector and degree of \ncoherence computed is used to assign quality flags to the derived vector. The value of quality \nflag falls sharply by an exponential function, as the disagreement of a given vector with its \nsurroundings increases. Here each vector wind is represented by a complex \nnumber\nj\ni\nj\ni\nc\nj\ni\nv\ni\nu\nV\n,\n,\n,\n\n\n. For every new vector under consideration, (from current image-\npair), its vector difference from the buffer is computed at the same as well as 3 X 3 \nneighborhood (Fig. 1), provided, the vectors to be compared show similar brightness \ncharacteristics (to maintain the similar height). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig 1: A schematic diagram of quality control process. \n \nMid infra-red wind vectors \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n221\nHere X (cross sign) at the centre of first box represents the current vector under consideration \nand O (circle sign) represents spatial and temporal neighborhood vectors.

If all spatial and temporal \nneighborhood vectors are present, then the difference set will contain 72 vectors (9 spatial \nneighborhoods with 8 temporal scales). However, all vectors may not be there all the times. \nThe quality control process begins if at least 10 vector differences\ndif\nV\n, excluding the \ndifference corresponding to current (i, j), are present in the set. In the next step, set of vector \ndifferences \n\ndif\nV\n is arranged in ascending order. The quality control process begins is the \naverage of 10 \ndif\nV\n is greater than 2.5 m/s. In the next step, the QI value for each vector is \ndetermined by using EUMETSAT procedure where four different tests are performed, which \nis normalized by a tanh-function that returns the value between 0 and 1. A weighted average \nof these individual quality indicators is then used for screening of poor quality vectors from \nfinal output. If any vector is not present in the immediate two pairs, then in-stead of rejecting, \nsearch process goes to the previous time steps of the wind buffer and if still it is not present it \ngoes to next previous times steps and so on. \n \n If  S is the mean “speed” of a vector computed from two pair of images, then different \nquality functions are computed as below : \n \n       Direction Consistency Function: \n          \n1\n)\n)\n/\nexp(\ntanh(\n0.1\n1\n1\n1\nD\nC\nB\nS\nA\nDCF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n      \n       Speed Consistency Function: \n          \n2\n)\n)\n,\n(\ntanh(\n0.1\n2\n2\n2\nD\nC\nB\nS\nA\nMAX\nS\nSCF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n         \n     Vector Consistency Function: \n          \n3\n)\n)\n,\n(\ntanh(\n0.1\n3\n3\n3\nD\nC\nB\nS\nA\nMAX\nV\nVCF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n   Spacial Consistency Function: \n          \n4\n)\n)\n,\n(\ntanh(\n0.1\n2\n4\n4\nD\nm\nC\nB\nS\nA\nMAX\nV\nPCF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nIn the above formulation, \nV\nS \n\n\n,\n,\n\nrepresent the difference of direction (degrees), \ndifference of speed, and the length of the difference vector between first and second satellite \nwind component. \nm\nV\n\nis the length of difference vector between satellite wind component \nand its best neighbor.

In the current method, the vector under consideration receives support from the \npast eight images. This method produces higher number of valid retrieval in the low-level \nand captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. To explain this more explicitly, \nif we take eight satellite images each with 30-minute interval stating at 00:00 UTC to 03:30 \nUTC, then winds retrieved using each-image pair are stored as buffer in a file and \nrepresented as wind buffer generated at 03:30 UTC. The buffer generated at 03:30 UTC is \nused for quality control for wind retrieved using 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images and the \nsecond image time is given as actual observation time of retrieved wind. For example winds \nretrieved using 03:30 UTC wind buffer and 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images is given as \n04:00 UTC observation time. As a whole to complete the process once it requires nine \nimages. Similarly the buffer is updated at every 30-minute with the latest available image and \nprocess is repeated for next cycle of wind retrieval. This method produces higher number of \nvalid retrieval in all levels and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. \n \n14.4.2 Operational Implementation \n \n \n14.4.2.1 Step 1: Tracer selection from image \n Cloud tracer selection will be done by evaluating the local image anomaly \nsurrounding each pixel in the target array and selecting the maximum brightness \ntemperature of the window.    \n \n14.4.2.2  Step 2: Height assignment \n Assign height of the selected tracer using IR window technique. In this case the \nbrightness temperature in the target window will be averaged and matched with \ncollocated numerical model temperature profile. The level of optimum fit will \nbe assigned as initial height. \n Re-assign the height using cloud-base height assignment technique. \n Assign correct height after implementing all the height assignment technique \nmentioned above. \n \n \n14.4.2.3  Step 3: Tracking \n The tracking employs a simple search for the mean absolute difference of the \nradiance difference between the target and search arrays in subsequent half hourly \nimages. This search will be done in the direction of   30o of model wind. \n \n14.4.2.4 Step 4: Wind buffer generation & quality control \n The wind buffer is created using previous eight images between pairs of images \n(viz. the winds retrieved between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored \nMid infra-red wind vectors \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n223\nin a file.

It is suggested to report mean \nvector difference (MVD) and standard deviation (SD). The standard accuracy according to \nCGMS guideline for CMV is that the root mean square error (RMSE) for WV winds should \nbe 7m/s respectively with respect to radiosonde observations.  The mean bias for both sets of \nwinds should be about zero. \n14.7 \nTechnical Issues (Limitations etc) \nAccuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the registration of the images. If the \nregistration has an error of 1 pixel, then error of the final product will be increased. However \nthe following limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind. The spatially coherent, \nhigh resolution coverage of upper tropospheric winds is possible from geostationary satellite \nremote sensing of water vapor. MIR wind is comparable in quality to operational upper-level \ncloud-motion vectors. However, the retrieved vectors in regions are lacking in defining \nmoisture structure, though they have the ability to obtain track-able information in extremely \ndry air masses and regions of strong subsidence is limited. The individual vectors represent \nsingle level reports; however, upper level vertical winds profiles are possible by using multi-\nspectral observations. \n   \n1. Sensitivity of error in height assignment to the error in wind speed retrieval \n \nThis sensitivity will depend upon the structure of wind circulation over different \nvertical levels as well as different geographical regions. For example, in the vicinity \nof atmospheric jets, the retrieved wind vectors will be highly sensitive to the errors in \nthe assigned pressure levels. Based on some standard analysis (e.g. NCEP reanalysis \nof 6-hourly sampling), we will provide a quantitative assessment of the vertical and \nspatial structure of this sensitivity. \n \n2.Numerical model to be used for AMV height assignment \n \nWe plan to use IMD’s operational regional model output during height assignment \nprocedure. However, if the domain of this regional model is smaller than the area of \nAMV retrieval, either IMD may be requested to increase the domain of its operational \nmodel, or a lower-quality solution based on the output of coarser-resolution GCM \nwill be generated over the regions not covered by IMD’s regional model. \n \n \n3. Whether RT model to be used in real-time for height assignment   \n \nTo use RT model in real-time height-assignment application is generally required to \nfind the optimum solution. However, it is computationally expensive and may \nincrease the AMV turn-around time very significantly. Efforts are currently underway \nto develop an empirical version of RT model that can be used for simulation of IR \nand water-vapor channel radiances for a variety of cloud heights. The inverse of this \nempirical model will then be used in real-time applications.  \n \nMid infra-red wind vectors \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n226\n4.

K. Thapliyal \nM. V. Shukla \nShivani Shah \n \nUTH Baseline Document \n 15.2 Introduction \nUpper Tropospheric Humidity (UTH) is an estimate of the mean relative humidity of the \natmosphere between approximately 600 hPa and 300 hPa. UTH is basically a measure of \nweighted mean of relative humidity according to the weighting function of the water \nvapour channel. Therefore, UTH is more likely a representative of the relative humidity \naround the atmospheric layer where weighting function of water vapour channel peaks \n \n15.2.1 Overview and background \nUpper tropospheric humidity from satellite measurements is useful to monitor changes in \nwater vapour in the upper troposphere on a global and regional scale. Several methods \nhave been developed for retrieving UTH from water vapour channel measurements \n(Schmetz and Turpeinen, 1988; Soden and Bretherton, 1993, 1996; Stephens et al, 1996). \nChanges in relative humidity around this layer would contribute maximum to the changes \nin the radiances received in this channel.    \n \nUTH extraction is in principle the calculation of single-column values for the upper \ntropospheric humidity. The physics involved is the quantitative description of the transfer \nof the WV channel radiances from the radiation emitting surface through the atmosphere \ntowards the satellite as calculated by radiative transfer model. The transfer calculations \nare performed for a set of different constant humidity values for the upper tropospheric \natmosphere for standard atmosphere representing different months/seasons. Empirical \ncoefficients generated for different months are then used to derive from the IR and WV \nradiation measured by the satellite to estimate an average of the upper tropospheric \nhumidity that caused the emitted radiation to be attenuated to the values measured. Only \nthe pixels of surface and low cloud clusters are used, excluding the pixels of \ncontamination with medium and high cloud clusters from the processing.  \n \n15.2.2 Objective \nUpper tropospheric humidity \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n232\nIn this project the algorithm will be developed for computing Upper Tropospheric \nHumidity (UTH) from WV channels 6.7 m of VHRR onboard Kalpana –1, INSAT-3A \nand Imager onboard future INSAT-3D satellite.  \n15.3 \nInputs \n15.3.1 Static Data \n  \nParameter  \nResolution \nAccuracy  Source \nAtmospheric profile \n(2311) of Temperature, \nWater Vapour, Ozone \n- \n- \nTIGR-3 data base  \n(Chevallier, Che´din, \nChe´ruy, & Morcrette, 2000) \n41 diverse profiles of \ntemperature, water \nvapour, Ozone \n- \n- \nECMWF \nSeeBor dataset of diverse \nprofiles (~12000)  \n- \n- \nSeeman and Borbas, \nCIMSS/SSEC  \n \n15.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic)  \n \nParameter \nResolution \nQuantization \nAccuracy \nSource \n \nRadiometric and \ngeometric corrected \ngray count values of \nWV channel#2 (5.7-\n7.1) of INSAT-\n3A/Kalpana and \nChannel#4 (6.5-7.1) \nof INSAT-3D Imager \nPixel \n10bit \n- \nDerived from \nraw data by \nDP (data \nprocessing) \nRadiometric and \ngeometric corrected \ngray count values of \nTIR channel#3 (10.5-\n12.5) for INSAT-\n3A/Kalpana and Imager \nChannel#5 (10.2-11.3) \nfor INSAT-3D \npixel \n10 bit \n- \nDerived from \nraw data by \nDP \nCoefficients for \nconversion of Gray \nvalue to radiances \n- \n- \n- \nDerived by \nDP \nGeolocation file \nPixel \n- \n1 pixel \nDerived by \nDP \n \n15.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications \n \nUpper tropospheric humidity \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n233\n15.4.1 Overview \nStandard tropical atmospheric profile has been used to simulate VHRR radiances using \nSBDART model. Filter response function for the INSAT-3A/ Kalpana-1 WV channel \nwas  provided as input to the SABDART. Standard profile was modified by replacing \nspecific humidity at levels above 600 hPa to represent constant relative humidty ranging \nfrom 2 to 100% with the interval of 2%. Satellite zenith angle was varied from 0 to 75 \ndegrees at an interval of 5 degree for each constant relative humidity profile. Radiances \nwere simulated for each set of profile and zenith angle at the top of atmosphere (100 km) \nfrom SBDART for VHRR WV channel. Brightness temperature is computed from \nsimulated radiances using the following relationship: \n  \n   Tb6.7 = A/ ln{(B/R) + 1} \n \nWhere, A and B are constants, Tb is Brightness Temperature in K and R is Radiance in \nmW/cm2/Sr/µ. \n  \nA bilinear regression relationship is established between ln{uth/cos()}  and water \nvapour channel brightness temperature Tb6.7 in the form: \nLn{UTH/cos()}= a + b.Tb6.7                                                   ----  (1) \nWhere,  is the satellite zenith angle of the corresponding pixel, and a and b are the \nregression coefficients. We obtain the following relationship for the UTH with satellite \nzenith angle and measured brightness temperature (Fig.1): \n \nUTH = cos() * exp(-a1* Tb6.7 + b1)             for Tb6.7 < 240.0     ----- (2a) \n(with R2 = 0.9965)  \nAnd, \nUTH = cos() * exp(-a2 * Tb6.7 + b2)             for TbWV > 240.0   ----- (2b) \n(with R2 = 0.9989) \n \nUpper tropospheric humidity \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n234\nINSAT-3A/ Kalpana WV brightness temperature (TbWV) vs \nUpper Tropospheric relative humidity  (UTH)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n225\n230\n235\n240\n245\n250\n255\n260\n265\nTbWV\nLn{UTH/cos(zen)}\nLn{UTH/cos(zen)} = -0.133*TbWV + 35.32\nR2 = 0.9989 (for TbWV > 240.0)\nLn{UTH/cos(zen)} = -0.165*TbWV + 42.96\nR2 = 0.9965 (for TbWV < 240.0) \n \nFig.1  INSAT WV Brightness Temperature vs UTH \n \nThe algorithm uses water vapour channel of the INSAT-3A/Kalpana-1 VHRR (5.7-7.1) \nto estimate the upper tropospheric humidity in absence of middle and upper level clouds. \nThe generation of the UTH product is directly based on the WV brightness temperatures. \nEach water vapour image is converted into different segments of 16 x 16 pixels as the \naveraging would reduce the error in measurements and also helps removes the pixels with \npartial cloud cover. The WV image pixels of each segment not belonging to \ncontamination with medium and high cloud clusters are averaged (if there are any, \notherwise no UTH value is derived for such a segment). Presently, pixels with middle and \nupper clouds are removed using a threshold value of IR brightness temperature of 270 K. \nAdditionally, if UTH value exceeds 110%, then pixel is assumed to be cloud \ncontaminated. However, this approach needs further modification. These segment WV \nbrightness temperatures are used to derive an upper tropospheric relative humidity by \nusing the empirical relation (2). \n \nBrightness temperatures depend strongly upon the satellite zenith angle since it increases \nthe path length for the radiances reaching the satellite. Therefore, zenith angle is \ncomputed for each segment to be used with the regression equation.

SBDART is designed for the analysis of a \nwide variety of radiative transfer problems encountered in satellite remote sensing and \natmospheric energy budget studies. SBDART is based on a collection of highly \ndeveloped and reliable physical models developed by the atmospheric science community. \nA brief description to the key components of the model are discussed below:  \nCloud Model: Clouds are a major modulator of the earth’s climate by reflecting visible \nradiation and intercepting part of the infrared radiation emitted by the Earth and re-\nradiating it back to the surface. The computation of radiative transfer within a cloudy \natmosphere requires knowledge of the scattering efficiency, the single scattering albedo, \nand the asymmetry factor, which indicates the strength of forward scattering. SBDART \ncontains an internal database of these parameters for clouds computed with a Mie \nscattering code and covers a range of particle size effective radius in the range 2 to \n128um. By default, the angular distribution of scattered photons is based on the simple \nHenyey-Greenstein parameterization, but more detailed scattering functions may be input \nas desired.  \nGas Absorption Model: Standard SBDART uses low-resolution band models developed \nfor the LOWTRAN 7 atmospheric transmission code (Pierluissi and Marogoudakis, \n1986). These models provide the clear sky atmospheric transmisson from 0 to 50000 cm-1 \nand include the effects of all radiatively active molecular species found in the earth's \natmosphere. The models were derived from detailed line-by-line calculations, which were \ndegraded to 20 cm-1 resolutions for use in LOWTRAN. This translates to a wavelength \nresolution of about 5 nm in the visible and about 200 nm in the thermal infrared. A \ncapability to read high-resolution k-distribution optical depths from a disk file is \nintroduced in SBDART version 2.0 which is less convenient to use than the standard \napproach. However, it has the advantage of removing limitations in the ultimate spectral \nresolution available with SBDART.  \nExtraterrestrial Source Spectra: SBDART has options for three extraterrestrial solar \nspectrum models: LOWTRAN-7 solar spectrum (Shettle and Fenn, 1975), solar models \nused in 5s (Tanre, 1988) or MODTRAN-3 solar spectrum.  \nStandard Atmospheric Models: SBDART has six standard atmospheric profiles from \nthe 5s atmospheric radiation code to model the following typical climatic conditions: \ntropical, midlatitude summer, midlatitude winter, subarctic summer, subarctic winter and \nUS62. These model atmospheres (McClatchey et al, 1971) have been widely used in the \natmospheric research community and provide standard vertical profiles of pressure, \ntemperature, water vapor and ozone density. Optionally users can specify their own \nmodel atmosphere, e.g, a radiosonde profile. The concentration of trace gases such as \nCO2 or CH4 are assumed to make up a fixed fraction (which may be specified by the \nuser) of the total particle density.  \nStandard Aerosol Models: SBDART can compute the radiative effects of several \ncommon boundary layer and upper atmosphere aerosol types. In the boundary layer, the \nUpper tropospheric humidity \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n237\nuser can select from rural, urban, or maritime aerosols. The total vertical optical depth of \nboundary layer aerosols is derived from user specified horizontal meteorologic visibility \nat 0.55 µm and an internal vertical distribution model. In the upper atmosphere up to 5 \naerosol layers can be specified, with radiative characteristics that model fresh and aged \nvolcanic, meteoric and the climatological tropospheric background aerosols. The aerosol \nmodels included in SBDART were derived from those provided in the 5s and \nLOWTRAN7.  \nRadiative Transfer Equation Solver: The radiative transfer equation is numerically \nintegrated with DISORT (DIScreet Ordinate Radiative Transfer, Stamnes et al, 1988). \nThe discrete ordinate method provides a numerically stable algorithm to solve the \nequations of plane-parallel radiative transfer in a vertically inhomogeneous atmosphere. \nThe intensity of both scattered and thermally emitted radiation can be computed at \ndifferent heights and directions. SBDART is configured to allow up to 65 atmospheric \nlayers and 40 radiation streams (40 zenith angles and 40 azimuthal modes).  \nSurface Models: The ground surface cover is an important determinant of the overall \nradiation environment. In SBDART six basic surface types -- ocean water, lake water, \nvegetation, snow and sand are used to parameterize the spectral reflectivity of the surface. \nThe spectral reflectivity of a large variety of surface conditions is well approximated by \ncombinations of these basic types. For example, the fractions of vegetation, water and \nsand can be adjusted to generate a new spectral reflectivity representing new/old growth, \nor deciduous vs. evergreen forest. Combining a small fraction of the spectral reflectivity \nof water with that of sand yields an overall spectral dependence close to wet soil.  \n \nThe diverse profiles datasets are used to construct monthly average temperature and \nhumidity profiles over INSAT observation area. Monthly averaged profiles are used to \nminimize the uncertainties due to seasonal variation of upper tropospheric temperature on \nUTH computation. For each month the average profile is perturbed by replacing water \nvapour at each levels between 600-200 hPa to make the relative humidity (RH) a constant \nvalue (=2, 4, 6….100%)  throughout the layer 600-200hPa and falls off linearly to ~0 \nfrom 200 hPa to 100 hPa in each of the perturbed profiles. Temperature and ozone \nprofiles are kept same for each perturbed profile in each month and only water vapour is \nchanged above 600 hPa level. Since each level between 600-200hPa has same RH value, \nthe weighted average value, i.e. UTH is equal to RH for each perturbed profile. Water \nvapour channel brightness temperatures for each perturbed profile at different zenith \nangle (0, 5, 10…..60°) are simulated using the Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric \nRadiative Transfer (SBDART) model (Ricchiazzi, Yang, Gautier, & Sowle, 1998). The \nradiative transfer computations are carried out separately for each satellite (INSAT-3A, \nKalpana, and INSAT-3D) using sensor response functions of water vapour channels for \nsimulating realistic satellite radiances. For each profile, the main inputs for the radiative \ntransfer computations are:  atmospheric profiles of temperature, water vapour, and ozone \nconcentrations. These simulations are carried out for average profiles corresponding to \ndifferent months. Regression analysis is carried out separately for each satellite and each \nmonths independently and the regression coefficients are obtained between  \n[UTH/cos()] and water vapour channel brightness temperature, where  is zenith angle. \nThese coefficients may be used to retrieve the UTH from satellite observations of water \nUpper tropospheric humidity \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n238\nvapour channel by choosing appropriate coefficient represent the particular satellite and \nmonth of observation. \n \n15.4.2.2   Flow Chart \n \nINSAT/Kalpana \nIR and WV data \nfiles\nConversion from \nGrey count to \nBrightness Temp. \nLook-up table file \n(calibration table) \nCloud detection \n(Elimination of cloudy \npixel by threshold) \nBTir > 270 & UTH < 110 \n& \nno. of cloudy pixel  < 75% of \nthe box \nCalculate zenith \nangle \nUTH retrieval \nUTH coefficient \n(satellite, month) \nGeolocation file \nUTH.dat  \nASCII file  \nUpper tropospheric humidity \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n239\n15.4.3 Operational Implementation \n15.4.2.1 \nStep 1 : Conversion of Grey count to Brightness temperature : \nThe grey count values in the IR and WV geo-corrected files are converted into the \nbrightness temperature values using the static look-up table file, which is generated \nduring characterization of the instruments on the ground before launch. This LUT file is \nprovided along with the data set. \n \n15.4.2.2 \nStep 2 : Cloud detection: \nAll the data in the cold space and data falling beyond the 60 radius from the sub-satellite \npoints are excluded from further calculations. Cloudy pixels are identified and these \npixels are also excluded from further calculations. The threshold used to eliminate the \ncloudy pixel is that if brightness temperature of thermal IR window channel is less than \nor equal to 270 and if the UTH calculated at that pixel is > 110 then it is a cloudy pixel, \nand hence eliminated. In the 5 x 5 pixel box, if the number of cloudy pixels is more than \n75 % than the whole box is considered as cloudy and excluded from UTH retrieval. \n \n15.4.2.3 \nStep 3:  Zenith angle calculation: \nAfter the cloudy pixels are discarded then the zenith angle is calculated for the pixels \nusing Equation (3). \n \n15.4.2.4 \nStep 4 : UTH retrieval:  \nUsing the above calculated zenith angle and the UTH coefficients for corresponding \nsatellite and month of the observation, UTH is calculated from Equation (2) using the \nwater vapour channel brightness temperature.

UTH is weighted average of relative humidity weighted by the \nwater vapour weighting function at each atmospheric level. These estimates of observed \nUTH are compared with the collocated satellite retrieved UTH.  \nThese estimates of UTH can also be compared with retrieved product of Meteosat \nsatellite located over Indian Ocean region. Because the extracted UTH product is \ndependent on the WV channel calibration, these UTH/radiosonde comparisons may also \nprovide a method of checking the actual WV calibration coefficients. Brightness \ntemperature observations of satellite WV channels may also be used with simulated \nbrightness temperature from collocated radiosonde profile to compute the bias correction \ncoefficients in the RT model.  \n 15.7 Technical issues ( limitation etc.) \nAccuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the radiation model to simulate the \nsatellite radiances. However the following limitations of the present study have to be kept \nin mind. \n \ni)      It is assumed that upper tropospheric temperature does not deviate by a large \namount from the mean monthly profile.  \nii)     Satellite receives only a negligible amount of radiance emitted from layers beneath \n600 hPa. The atmosphere above 200 hPa is represented by decreasing the relative \nhumidity to 0% at 100 hPa, which seems to be a reasonable assumption consistent \nwith the structure of standard profiles and observations. \niii)     The reason for using mean monthly profiles of water vapour at lower levels as \ninput to the radiative transfer model is that these levels contribute very little to the \noutgoing radiance. \n 15.8 Future Scope \nThese coefficients can be improved with the availability of more accurate radiation \nmodels in future. UTH algorithm in future may include the upper tropospheric mean \ntemperature derived from model forecast to minimize the uncertainties due to the \ntemperature variations in the 600-200 hPa layer.  \n15.9  References \n1.

INSAT-3D Sounder \nchannels are similar to those in GOES-12 Sounder and many of the spectral bands are similar \nto High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) onboard NOAA-ATOVS. Hence, \npresent algorithm for INSAT-3D Sounder is adapted from the operational HIRS and GOES \nalgorithms developed by Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS), \nUniversity of Wisconsin. \nThis module also describes the background to retrieval problem, theoretical basis of the \nretrieval algorithm for vertical profiles, practical aspects of algorithm implementation, and \noutline of the planned validation approach. INSAT-3D Sounder instrument characteristics are \ngiven in the appendix-1 at the end. \n \n16.2.1 Overview and Background: \nINSAT-3D Sounder observations will provide vertical profiles of temperature and humidity \nin clear-sky conditions besides total column ozone and various other derived products. \nAtmospheric profile retrieval algorithm for INSAT-3D Sounder is a two-step approach. The \nfirst step includes generation of accurate hybrid first guess profiles using combination of \nstatistical regression retrieved profiles and model forecast profiles. The second step is \nnonlinear physical retrieval to improve the resulting first guess profile using Newtonian \niterative method.  \nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n246\nThe retrievals will be performed using clear sky radiances measured by Sounder within a 5x5 \nfield of view (approximately 50 km resolution) over land and ocean for both day and night. \nFour sets of regression coefficients will be generated. Two sets for land and ocean daytime \nconditions and the other two sets for land and ocean night-time conditions using a training \ndataset comprising historical radiosonde observations representing atmospheric conditions \nover INSAT-3D observation region.  \nThe retrieval algorithm discussed here is adapted from CIMSS algorithm for GOES-Sounder \nand is primarily based on the retrieval algorithms of Li et al. (2000), Ma et al. (1999), Smith \nand Woolf (1988) and Hayden (1988). Temperature and moisture profiles at Sounder \nresolution are required for numerical weather prediction in short to medium range besides \nvarious other weather and climate applications. High temporal resolution of sounding data \nfrom geostationary satellite INSAT-3D will provide a wealth of new information on \natmospheric structure in clear-sky conditions. Retrieval of atmospheric profiles at high \nspatial and temporal resolutions will immensely improve mesoscale prediction.  \n \n16.2.2 History of atmospheric sounding \nKing (1956) was first to suggest that atmospheric temperature profiles could be inferred from \nsatellite observations of thermal infrared emission and explained the feasibility of retrieving \nthe temperature profile from the satellite intensity scan measurements. Further advances were \nmade for the temperature-sounding concept when Kaplan demonstrated (1959) that vertical \nprofile of temperature could be inferred from the spectral distribution of emission by \natmospheric gases. He suggested that observations in the wings of a spectral band sense \ndeeper regions of the atmosphere; whereas observations in the band center see only the very \ntop layer of the atmosphere. Thus by properly selecting a set of sounding spectral channels at \ndifferent wavelengths in the absorption band, the observed radiances could be used to \nestimate the vertical temperature profile in the atmosphere. \nFollowing a proposal by Wark (1961) for satellite vertical sounding program to measure \natmospheric temperature profiles, the first satellite-sounding instrument (SIRS-A) was \nlaunched on NIMBUS-3 in 1969 (Wark et al., 1970). NOAA launched the TIROS \nOperational Vertical Sounder in 1978 (TOVS, Smith et al. 1979), consisting of High-\nresolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS), Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU), and the \nStratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU) onboard satellites NOAA-6 to NOAA-14. HIRS provides \n17 km spatial resolution at nadir with 19 infrared sounding channels (4-15), whereas MSU \nprovides 109 km resolution at nadir with 4 microwave channels (~50 GHz). SSU has 3 \nchannels in the far IR (~15) for stratospheric measurements. Current NOAA series satellites \nNOAA-15 and NOAA-16 (and future satellite in the NOAA series) have ATOVS with \nHIRS/3, and MSU and SSU have been replaced by AMSU-A and AMSU-B to improve the \ntemperature and humidity sounding. HIRS/3 has the same spectral bands as the HIRS/2. \nAMSU-A uses 15 microwave channels around 23, 30, 50 and 90 GHz of oxygen absorption \nbands with resolution of 50 km at nadir. AMSU-B uses 5 microwave channels around 90, \n150 and 190 GHz with a horizontal resolution of 17 km at nadir.  \nNew generation of infrared atmospheric sounder is the hyper-spectral sounder with thousands \nof channels instead of few tens of infrared bands. Atmospheric Infra-Red Sounder (AIRS) \nonboard EOS-Aqua satellite was launched on May 4, 2002 and is providing a wealth of \nhighly accurate atmospheric and surface information using 2378 high-spectral-resolution \nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n247\ninfrared (3.7 – 15.4 ) channels with horizontal resolution of 10 km at nadir. AIRS along \nwith AMSU forms a state-of-art atmospheric sounding tool for temperature profiles with \naccuracy of 1 C in a 1 km thick layer and humidity profile with an accuracy of 20% in 2 km \nthick layer in the troposphere.

INSAT-3D \nSounder retrieval scheme involves two-step approach. In first step, first-guess temperature \nand humidity profiles are derived based on regression retrieval combined with model \nforecast. In the second step, accurate temperature and humidity profiles are retrieved based \non physical retrieval procedure that uses non-linear Newtonian iterative method to adjust first \nguess profiles. Ozone profile and integrated amount is retrieved using regression retrieval \nand used as first guess for the physical retrieval routine. \n16.4.1.1 \nTheoretical Background \nAtmospheric sounding is one of the most important applications of satellite measurements in \nmeteorology, which involves retrieving vertical profiles of temperature and trace-gas \nconcentrations, especially water vapor and ozone, using observations at wavelengths that \nhave significant attenuation in atmosphere. For this we need to know the variation of \ntemperature with altitude, and the variation of the density of atmospheric gases with altitude, \nsuch as carbon dioxide, water vapor and ozone. Water vapor is important because of its \nmeteorological impact and its importance for atmospheric correction in thermal infrared \nmeasurements. \nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n249\nAtmospheric sounding techniques exploit all three phenomena that that play important role in \nradiative transfer: namely absorption, scattering and thermal emission. Most observations are \nmade in the thermal infrared and microwave bands. At infrared wavelengths scattering due to \natmospheric gases is negligible, hence it is not considered in the radiative transfer process.  \nFor vertical sounding at infrared wavelengths the significant terms in the radiative transfer \nequation (RTE) are absorption and thermal emission. This simplification is called \nSchwartzchild’s equation. Here, we will consider only cloud-free conditions. If a sensor \nviews vertically downwards into the atmosphere at a wavelength at which the atmosphere is \noptically thick, the brightness temperature/radiances that are received by sensor will be \ncharacteristic of the atmosphere at a depth below the sensor that is of the order of the \nabsorption length. Thus for bigger absorption coefficient, the absorption length is smaller and \nhence the temperature signal is received from higher altitude. So by making observations at a \nnumber of wavelengths near a broad absorption line, different altitudes in the atmosphere can \nbe investigated. Thermal infrared temperature profilers normally employ the broad and deep \nCO2 lines near 15 m wavelengths. \nRadiative transfer equation in the non-scattering case may be written in simple form as: \nWhere,  \n \n \n-Surface emissivity \nτ(p0) \n-Vertical transmittance from level with pressure p to space \nT(p) \n \n-vertical profile of temperature and  \nB[T(p)] \n-corresponding Planck function profile.  \nThis equation implies that the radiance received at a particular wavelength is sum of three \nterms on the right hand side: first term is upwelling radiance from the surface, second term is \ndirect atmospheric emission term and the third term is reflected downward atmospheric \nemission reaching at satellite sensor. (/p) is called a weighting function. It weights the \nPlanck function in the atmospheric component of the emitted radiation. It specifies the layer \nfrom which the radiation emitted to space originates, and hence it determines the region of \nthe atmosphere that can be sensed from space at this wavelength. Fig.1 shows the \ntransmittance profiles and corresponding weighting functions at three wavelengths for which \nthe atmospheric absorption is different. Since the weighting function is the derivative of the \ntransmittance profile, it will peak higher in the atmosphere for the wavelengths at which the \nabsorption is stronger. In this way, if the atmosphere is observed at a number of carefully \nchosen wavelengths, whose weighting functions sample the atmosphere, then it is possible to \nretrieve the Planck’s function Bλ(T) and thereby the temperature T itself. \nTo explain this form of weighting functions, we consider the emission to space from air \nparcels of unit volume at different heights in the atmosphere. The radiation emitted to space \nis determined by three factors: temperature of the air parcel, number density of emitting gas, \nand transmittance of the atmosphere from the air parcel to space. For the lowest parcel, the \natmospheric density is high and so the amount of radiation emitted is high, but most of the \nradiation is absorbed in the atmosphere above it and very little reaches space. For the highest \nparcel, the transmittance to space is high, but comparatively little radiation is emitted because \n)1(\n.)\n(\n)].\n(\n[\n).\n0\n(\n).\n1(\n.)\n0\n(\n)].\n(\n[\n)\n0\n(\n).\n(\n.\n)\n0\n(\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns\ns\np\np\ni\ns\ns\ns\ndp\np\np\np\np\nT\nB\np\ndp\np\np\np\nT\nB\np\nT\nB\np\nI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n250\natmospheric density decreases exponentially with height. These two contrasting effects \ncombine in such a way that, at some intermediate height, the contribution of a parcel to the \nradiation reaching space is a maximum. The variation of the radiance to space as a function \nof height is shown by the curve on the right of the Fig.1. \nMost of the radiation to space originates in a layer around the peak of weighting function. \nFrom the knowledge of atmospheric composition and spectroscopic parameters we can \ncalculate where in the atmosphere this layer will be. Then the intensity of the radiation can be \ninterpreted in terms of the mean temperature of the layer. Using radiation at different \nfrequencies for which the absorption strength is different, we can build a group of weighting \nfunctions, which provide information on the mean temperatures of many such layers, thus \nleading to the retrieval of the atmospheric temperature profile from a set of multi-frequency \nmeasurements. \nIt is important to note that the weighting functions are broad, implying that the satellite \ninstrument can sense the mean properties of broad layers very well, but it is only able to \nsense the characteristics of single levels or narrow layers insofar as they are correlated with \nthe properties of the broad layers. Broad nature of the weighting functions restricts the \ncapability of satellite sounders to detect small-scale vertical structure of the atmospheric. \nInfrared sounder channels have spectral widths typically hundreds of times greater than the \natmospheric absorption lines. Therefore they average frequencies for which the absorption \nstrengths are very different. This has the effect of broadening the weighting functions \nconsiderably. By using instruments of much higher spectral resolution, such as \ninterferometers or grating spectrometers (e.g. AIRS, IASI), it is possible to achieve spectral \nresolutions closer to the widths of the atmospheric absorption lines. In this way instruments \nwith several thousand channels and much sharper weighting functions can be built. \nIn order for atmospheric temperature to be inferred from measurements of thermal emission, \nthe source of emission must be a relatively abundant gas of known and uniform distribution. \nOtherwise, the uncertainty in the abundance of the gas will make ambiguous the \ndetermination of temperature from the measurements.

For each \nchannel, we can write a radiative transfer equation (excluding reflection term):  \n \nThis equation expresses the forward problem for the channel, i.e. given the state of the \natmosphere; the solution of this equation gives us the radiance incident at the satellite in this \nchannel. Using the radiances measured by the satellite radiometers, we can determine some \ninformation directly. For well-mixed gases such CO2, we assume that the mixing ratio is \nknown and independent of height. Wavelengths that are sensitive to these gases are used to \nretrieve atmospheric temperature. For wavelengths sensitive to variable trace gases, such as \nwater vapor and O3, we assume that the temperature profile is known and use the radiances to \nretrieve mixing ratios. Unfortunately, no wavelengths are completely free of absorption by \nthe variable trace gases; this contributes to errors in retrieving temperatures. Also, errors in \nour knowledge of temperature profiles lead to errors in trace-gas retrievals.  \nThe above equations are strictly applicable only at a single wavelength, but satellite \ninstruments sense a band of wavelengths. So the equation must be integrated over \nwavelength using the spectral response function for each channel as a weight. This can be \nvery time-consuming. To overcome this problem, regression based fast transmittance models \nare formulated, in which the atmosphere is divided into predetermined layers, and the \ntransmittance of each layer, averaged over the response function of the radiometer is \ncalculated. Then the functions of temperature, humidity and zenith angle are fitted to the \nresults to generate regression coefficients for the fast model. \nThe inverse problem: \nInverse problem in the satellite meteorology is to obtain the state of the atmosphere (in terms \nof its vertical profiles of temperature and constituents) from the radiance measurements. \nSince we have a limited number of channels the inversion of equation is ill posed or under-\nconstrained. This means that there exist an infinite number of profiles that satisfy a given set \nof measurements. This is because the atmospheric state (unknown, e.g. temperature profile) \nis a continuous function of height, and measurements are from a finite number of channels. \nInverse problem is to find one that is reasonable and, if possible, to find the profile which is \nbest or most reasonable in some sense. In addition, the measurements always contain some \nerror or \"noise\". This further increases the ill-posed nature of the problem, and we must find \na method of solution that does not amplify the noise to an unacceptable degree. This implies \nthat we need information additional to the measurements in order to reach a solution. For \natmospheric remote sensing, additional information is available in the form of numerical \nmodel forecast and surface observation analysis.  \nThere are several approaches for solution of this problem:  \n1.

Statistical retrievals and \n3. Hybrid retrieval  \nIn a physical retrieval, the forward problem is exploited in an iterative procedure:  \n1. A first-guess temperature profile is chosen. \n2. The weighting functions are calculated.  \n3. The forward problem is solved to yield estimates of the radiance in each channel. \n4. If computed radiances match the observed ones (within noise) then the current profile \nis accepted as the solution. \n5. If convergence is not achieved, the current profile is adjusted.  \n6. Steps 3-5 are repeated until a solution is found. \nAn advantage of this approach is that physical processes are clearly evident at each stage. \nThe disadvantages are that the method is computationally intensive and it requires accurate \nknowledge about the transmittances. It also does not exploit the known statistical properties \nof the atmosphere. \nIn statistical retrieval, a training dataset, comprising radiosonde observations that are nearly \ncoincident in time and space with satellite soundings are compiled. A relationship between \nthe observed radiances and atmospheric profiles is established. In this approach physical \nprocesses are embedded in the statistics. \nAdvantages of this approach are (1) the actual retrievals are computationally simple (does not \nuse RTE) and (2) it requires no knowledge of the transmittances. It only uses the statistical \nproperties of the atmosphere. The disadvantage is that a large training data set is necessary.  \nHybrid retrieval methods are in between the first two approaches. They are much like \nstatistical retrievals, but they do not require a large training dataset. They use weighting \nfunctions like physical retrievals, but they do not directly involve integration of the RTE. \nHybrid methods are easier to apply than the statistical or physical methods. They require \nknowledge of the transmittances, and they employ statistical knowledge of the atmosphere.  \nTo summarize, there is no unique solution for the detailed vertical profile of temperature or \nan absorbing constituent because: \na. \nThe outgoing radiances arise from relatively deep layers of the atmosphere, \nb. \nThe radiances observed within various spectral channels come from overlapping layers \nof the atmosphere and are not vertically independent of each other, and \nc. \nMeasurements of outgoing radiance possess errors.  \nAs a consequence, there are a large number of analytical approaches to the profile retrieval \nproblem. The approaches differ both in the procedure for solving the set of spectrally \nindependent radiative transfer equations (e.g. matrix inversion, numerical iteration) and in the \ntype of ancillary data used to constrain the solution to insure a meteorologically meaningful \nresult (e.g. use of atmospheric covariance statistics, use of an a priori estimate of the profile \nstructure). Various methods of sounding retrievals have been reviewed by Fleming and \nSmith, 1971; Fritz et al., 1972; Rodgers, 1976; Twomey, 1977; and Houghton et al. 1984.  \nFollowing sections describe the mathematical basis for two-step procedure, which will be \nused in the development of retrieval algorithm for atmospheric profiles from INSAT-3D \nSounder measurements. \nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n253\n16.4.1.2 \nFlow Chart: \nPresent sounder retrieval algorithm includes two steps:  \n1.

This “forward problem” \nis the heart of the physically based retrieval algorithms. The high rate of satellite \nobservations requires a forward model fast enough to keep pace with the observations. \nThough line-by-line models exist to accurately compute atmospheric transmittances, they are \nfar too slow to be practical. Thus fast atmospheric transmittance models are required for \noperational atmospheric sounding using physical methods. For INSAT-3D Sounder channels \nwe use Pressure Layer Optical Depth (PLOD) model, also known as pressure layer fast \nalgorithm for atmospheric transmittances (PFAAST), developed by Hanon et al (1996). This \nmodel has been widely used for profiles retrieval algorithm for GOES, NOAA-\nTOVS/ATOVS, Aqua-AIRS/MODIS, etc (Li et al. 2000; Li et al. 2001 etc, Ma et al. 1999).  \nThe radiance recorded by the satellite sensor is the convolution of incident spectral radiance \nfunction with instrument’s spectral response function (SRF). Computing simulated radiances \nby calculating the monochromatic radiances and then convolving it with the instrument’s \nSRF takes too much time to be practical. In fast model PLOD a polychromatic approximation \nfor the transmittances is made which directly computes the approximate convolved radiances. \nThe monochromatic radiance leaving the top of the atmosphere, excluding scattering and \nreflection, is given by \n)\n3\n(\n)]\n(\n)1\n(\n)).[\n(\n(\n)\n(\n))\n(\n(\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL\ni\nz\nz\nz\ns\ni\ni\ni\nT\nB\nL\ns\nT\nB\nR\n\n\n\n\n \nWhere, the atmospheric layers are numbered 1 to L from space to surface respectively. \nPLOD uses 101 atmospheric levels. B(T(i)) is the Planck function emission for layer ‘i’  at \ntemperature T(i) and z(i) is layer-to-space transmittance from layer ‘i’ to space. s is surface \nemissivity and T(s) is surface temperature. Applying the polychromatic approximation, we \nconvolve the layer-to-space transmittances and compute the radiances using above equation \ninstead of convolving the monochromatic radiances. PLOD model relates the convolved \nlayer-to-space transmittances to a simple function involving various profile dependent \npredictors. These predictors are functions of layer pressure, temperature, absorber amount, \nand viewing angle. Convolved transmittance is given by: \n)\n4\n(\n)\nln(\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\ni\ni\ni\neff\nQ\nc\n\n \neff  is the effective layer transmittance, Qi is the profile dependent predictor, and ci are the \nfast transmittance coefficients determined by linear regression of the above equation for a set \nof representative atmospheric profiles. PLOD model uses a regression on –ln(), i.e. the \noptical depth (k). \nA set of profiles is selected for calculation of the layer-to-space transmittances, which is used \nfor regression in fast coefficient computation. These profiles represent the entire range of \natmospheric variation, and should be weighted towards more typical cases. Computation of \nconvolved layer-to-space transmittances is time consuming, thereby restricting the practical \nlimit of number of profiles to be used in the regression. We use 49 regression profiles (6 \nzenith angles upto 62.5), which cover most of profile behavior in the INSAT-3D viewing \nregion.  \nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n255\nAll profiles should cover necessary vertical levels for temperature and absorbing gases. \nAmong absorbing gases only water vapor and ozone are allowed to vary in mixing ratio, and \nother gases are held “fixed”. Fixed gases include all those whose spatial and temporal \nvariations have a negligible impact on the observed radiances. Monochromatic layer-to-space \ntransmittances computed for fixed and different absorbing gases at different zenith angles are \nconvolved with the instrument SRF. For each layer the effective layer optical depths (kfixed, \nkwater, kozone) are obtained for fixed and variable absorbing gases. These effective layer optical \ndepths are used in a regression analysis to compute the fast transmittance coefficients (ci). \nChoosing the set of predictors for accurate results is mainly a matter of trial and error. PLOD \nmodel uses 8 predictors for fixed gases (kfixed), 13 for water vapor (kwater), and 9 for ozone \n(kozone). These predictors are functions of temperature, water vapor, ozone profiles and sensor \nviewing angle, and are summarized as follows: \nkfixed:  \n1)  a \n \n2)   a2  \n3)  a.Tr   \n4)  a.(Tr)2 \n \n5)  Tr   \n6)  (Tr)2 \n7)  a.Tz  \n8)  a.Tz / Tr \nWhere, a is secant of the local path angle, Tr is the temperature ratio (Tprofile/Treference), and Tz is \nthe pressure weighted temperature ratio above the layer: \n \n)\n5\n(\n)1\n(\n)).\n1\n(\n)\n(\n).(\n(\n)\n(\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nl\ni\nr\nz\ni\nT\ni\nP\ni\nP\ni\nP\nl\nT\n  \nWhere P(i) is the average layer pressure for layer ‘i’. \nkwater: For water vapor predictors are divided into two parts: one for total water optical depth \nabove the layer < 5, i.e.  \n1)  W.a \n \n2)  (W.a) \n \n3)  W.a.dT \n \n4) (W.a)2 \n5) W.a.dT.|dT| \n6)  (W.a)3 \n \n7)  Wz.a \n \n8) (W.a).dT \n9) 4(W.a)  \n10)  (Wz.a)2 \n \n11)  (Wz.a) \nFor total water optical depth > 5, \n12) W.a \n \n13) W.a/(Wz.a)2 \n \nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n256\nW is water amount ratio (Wprofile/Wreference), dT is the temperature offset (Tprofile – Treference), \nand Wz is pressure weighted water amount of W, i.e. \n \n)\n6\n(\n)\n(\n)).\n1\n(\n)\n(\n).(\n(\n)\n(\n)).\n1\n(\n)\n(\n).(\n(\n)\n(\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nl\ni\nreference\nl\ni\nprofile\nx\ni\nW\ni\nP\ni\nP\ni\nP\ni\nW\ni\nP\ni\nP\ni\nP\nl\nW\n \nkozone: Predictors for ozone are: \n \n1) O.a \n \n2) (O.a) \n \n3) O.a.dT \n \n4) (O.a)2 \n5) (O.a).dT \n6)  Oz.a \n \n7) O.a.(Oz.a)  \n8) O.a.W.a \n9) TOz.O.a \n \nwhere O is ozone amount ratio (Oprofile/Oreference), Oz is the pressure weighted ozone \namount ratio above \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nl\ni\nz\ni\nO\ni\nP\ni\nP\ni\nP\nl\nO\n2\n)\n7\n(\n)1\n(\n)).\n1\n(\n)\n(\n).(\n(\n)\n(\n \nand TOz is pressure and ozone weighted temperature ratio above \n)\n8\n(\n)1\n(\n).\n1\n(\n)).\n1\n(\n)\n(\n).(\n(\n)\n(\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nl\ni\nr\nz\ni\nO\ni\nT\ni\nP\ni\nP\ni\nP\nl\nTO\n \nFinally the layer transmittance is given by, \neff = fixed * water * ozone       ------- (9) \n \n16.4.2.2 Cloud detection: \nSince atmospheric profiles can be retrieved only over cloud free observations, it is \nessential to detect the cloudy pixels. For each sounder pixel, a cloud detection algorithm \nis to be applied to get the clear/cloudy index. Various cloud-detection schemes are \ndeveloped and implemented for infrared sounders (Smith et al. 1979; McMillen and Dean \n1982; Hayden 1988). Each pixel undergoes several tests for clear/cloudy identifications: \n During daytime if visible channel#19 count is greater then a threshold, then the \npixel is considered cloudy. \n If longwave window channel (channel#8, 11.0m) brightness temperature is too \ncold (< 250) then the pixel is classified cloudy. \n If the longwave window brightness temperature is 4 K cooler than that of the \nwarmest pixel from 8 adjacent pixels, then this pixel is classified as cloudy. \n Different window channels (thermal IR channels 8 and mid IR window channels \n17, 18) have different transparency. After atmospheric correction to each \nchannel, few checks are applied to classify the pixel as clear/cloudy. During \ndaytime very high difference in channel 8 and 18 brightness temperature \nindicates presence of clouds. Thresholds for differences in different channels \nbrightness temperature are to be determined by RT simulations. \nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n257\n Sounder channel brightness temperatures are simulated for each pixel using \nnumerical model forecast profiles. If difference between simulated and observed \nsounder brightness temperature for cloud sensitive channels (3, 4, 5, 8, 13, 14, \n15) is large (threshold decided by the forward model error and forecast error), \nthen this pixel is classified as cloudy. \nIf there are at least 9 clear pixels in the field-of-regard (FOR) comprised of 5 x 5 \npixels (or 4 clear pixels in the FOR comprised of 3 x 3 pixels), then the average of all \npixels brightness temperatures for this FOR is used for clear-sky retrieval. This \naveraging reduces the random noise of measurements over individual pixels.  \n \n16.4.2.3 Regression Retrieval: \nA computationally efficient method for determining temperature and moisture profiles \nfrom satellite sounding measurements uses previously determined statistical relationships \nbetween observed (or modeled) radiances and the corresponding atmospheric profiles. \nThis method is often used to generate a first-guess for a physical retrieval algorithm, as is \ndone in the International TOVS Processing Package (ITPP, Smith et al., 1993) and \nInternational ATOVS Processing Package (IAPP, Li et al, 2000). The statistical \nregression algorithm for atmospheric temperature is described in detail in Smith et. al. \n(1970).  \nRegression coefficients are required to correlate observed radiances with vertical profile \nvectors. This derivation of regression coefficients in turn requires generation of training \ndataset from radiosonde profiles of temperature, humidity, ozone profiles, surface \npressure representing the entire variations. Training dataset generated by CIMSS/SSEC, \nUniversity of Wisconsin is used, which contains more then 12000 profiles. To include \nmore local data into the training dataset and to create a testing dataset, radiosonde data \nover INSAT-3D viewing region is collocated and quality checked. These are total \n~40,000 profiles spanning over 2 years, twice daily observations. Surface emissivities at \neach sounder channel wavelength for all profiles are assigned from the global emissivity \ndataset generated by Seeman et al. (2006) at CIMSS. Sounder radiances/brightness \ntemperature will be simulated using fast radiative transfer model (PLOD) and suitable \ninstrument noise will be added to the simulated radiances. Regression coefficients \nbetween atmospheric profile vector, X (T-, q-, O3-profiles, Ts), with Sounder \nobservations, Y (brightness temperatures) are computed at different zenith angles from \nsimulated training dataset using: \nRC = dX.dYT.(dY.dYT)-1                 --------- (10) \nWhere, dX = X - Xmean, and dY = Y - Ymean \nThese regression coefficients can be used to retrieve the atmospheric profiles, X, using \nthe following relation:  \nX = Xmean + RC.(dYobs)T              ---------- (11) \nEmissivity and surface pressure are also used as predictors along with the brightness \ntemperature observations to improve the retrieval accuracy. Quadratic term of all \nbrightness temperatures is used as predictors to account for the moisture non-linearity in \nthe sounder observations. Separate regression coefficients are generated for land and \nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n258\nsea for day and night conditions. Regression coefficients are generated for different \nlocal zenith angles from nadir to 62.5.  \nIf any one or more channels in sounder become unusable, then regression \ncoefficients will be recomputed from remaining well-behaved channels and suitable \nmodification will be done in regression retrieval routine. In absence of regression \nretrieval the first guess will be taken from the model forecast. \nAnother way to generate profile vectors through regression is by using the matchup file \nthat contains the time and space collocated satellite radiance measurements and \nradiosonde profiles used for generation of the regression coefficients. This may be \nattempted after the launch of satellite and when enough collocated data points have been \ngenerated to represent the profiles variability. The advantage of the regression retrieval \nusing the theoretically computed regression coefficients over real observations is that it \navoids errors due to space and time differences between satellite observation and \nradiosonde profile observation. Observed matchup data would be very useful for \nremoving the bias error caused by the forward model calculations.  \n16.4.2.4 Non-Linear Physical Retrieval \nThough statistical regression algorithm has the advantage of being computationally \nefficient, numerically stable, and simple, it does not account for the physical properties of \nthe radiative transfer equation (RTE). Therefore, after computing atmospheric profiles \nfrom the regression technique and creating a hybrid first-guess combining with model \nforecast, a non-linear iterative physical algorithm (Li et al., 2000, Ma et at. 1999, Seeman \nat al. 2003) is applied to the RTE to improve the solution.  \nFor non-scattering atmosphere in local thermodynamic equilibrium, the radiative transfer \nequation may be written as: Following derivation by Li et al (1994) the RTE may be \nwritten as linear perturbation form: \n)\n13\n(\n)\n(\n.\n))\n(\nln(\n.\n)\n(\n.\n.\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nls\ni\no\nls\ni\nls\ni\nq\nt\ns\nts\nb\ni\nT\nK\ni\nq\nK\ni\nT\nK\nT\nK\nT\n\n\n\n\n\n \nor simply, \nY= K.X                 ------------  (14) \nWhere, perturbation- is with respect to an a priori estimate or mean-conditions. Tb is \nSounder channel brightness temperature, and Kts, Kt, Kq and Ko are weighting functions \n(also known as Jacobian) of surface skin temperature, atmospheric temperature profile, \nhumidity profile and ozone profile respectively.

Usually H=I, where  is the smoothing \nfactor. Therefore, \nXn+1 = X0 + (Kn\nT E\n-1 Kn + nI)\n-1. {Kn\nT E\n-1 [dYn\nm + Kn (Xn – X0)]}      ------ (19) \nSmoothing factor  is very important in the solution and very difficult to determine. If  is \ntoo large then the solution is over-constrained and large biases could be created in the \nretrieval, while if  is too small, the solution is less constrained, and possibly unstable. \nThe value  is dependent upon the observations, the observation error, and the first guess \nof the atmospheric profile, and often chosen empirically (Smith et al. 1985; Hayden \n1988). Often it is chosen empirically (Susskind 1984; Smith et al. 1985; Hayden 1988). \nLi at al. (2000) uses discrepancy principle (Li and Huang 1999) to determine  and is \nchanged in each iteration according to \nn+1 = qn.n             ----------  (20) \nq is a factor for  increasing or decreasing. q is obtained in each iteration by the following \ncondition: \nq0 = 1;   if ||F(Xn) – Ym||2 < 2  then qn = 1.5        --------- (21a) \n  \n if ||F(Xn) – Ym||2 > 2  then qn = 0.8        --------- (21b) \nWhere, 2 =  ek2, ek is the observation error of channel k which includes instrument \nerror and forward model error. The q factor is found from empirical experience to ensure \nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n260\nthat the solution is stable from one iteration to the next. This factor would be required to \ntune-up carefully for the INSAT-3D Sounder channels. \nSince atmospheric variables correlate between different levels, only a limited number of \nvariables are needed to explain the vertical structure of atmosphere (Smith and woolf \n1976). Thus it is computationally efficient to solve the iterative equation. This reduces \nthe number of unknown expansion coefficients to the same order as the number of \nmeasured radiances: \n \nX = fivi = V.f, \n i = 1, M                              \n \n \n--------- (22) \nWhere, vi is the ith eigenvector, fi is the ith expansion coefficient, and M denotes the \nnumber of terms. V and f represent the eigenvector matrix and coefficient vector, \nrespectively. These eigenvectors are derived from a statistical covariance matrix of a \nlarge profile set of temperature, moisture and ozone.  \nY = K.X = K.V.f =K\n~\n.f       \n \n \n \n \n--------- (23) \nCorresponding iterative equation becomes, \nfn+1 = (K\n~\nn\nT E\n-1 K\n~\nn + nI)\n-1. {K\n~\nn\nT E\n-1 [dYn\nm + K\n~\nn fn)]}    \n---------- (24) \nThus the retrieval problem is reduced to finding a set of coefficients that may be used \nwith eigenvectors to update the meteorological variables. Statistical analysis of the GOES \nradiance information content (similar to INSAT-3D Sounder) reveals that five \ntemperature and three water vapor eigenvectors explain all the variance in the sounder \nchannels occurring above the instrument noise level (Ma et al 1999). Therefore, the \nphysical retrieval problem has been reduced to one of solving for ten unknowns (five \ntemperature eigenvector coefficients, three water vapor eigenvector coefficients, one \nozone eigenvector coefficient, plus surface skin temperature perturbation) from 18 \nINSAT Sounder observations plus two surface observations: surface air temperature and \nhumidity. In absence of the surface observations only sounder observations will be used \nfor observation vector. \nAt each iterative step in the physical retrieval procedure, convergence tests are carried out \nfor the quality control of the profile retrievals. Following two convergence tests are \ncarried out at each iteration and if one of the test fails, then the retrieval is rejected. \n(i) The expansion coefficient convergence test defines the coefficient distance, dn+1 \ndefined by: \ndn+1 = (fn+1 - fn)T.( K\n~\nnTE-1K\n~\nn + nI)-1 (fn+1 - fn)  \n \n------- (25) \nThis should approach zero as the solution converges. At each iteration, the norm of \nthe coefficient distance d is calculated and compared with previous iteration. If dn+1 \nis smaller or equal to dn then iteration continues, else n is increased, and dn+1 is \nrecalculated for the nth iteration. This procedure of changing  continues until the \nnorm of dn+1 is less then or equal to the norm of dn, and the iteration further \ncontinues towards convergence until the difference between the norm of dn+1 and \nthe norm of dn is less than an experimental threshold (~0.1). If the norm of dn+1 less \nthan or equal to the norm of dn is not met by the third increase in n, the retrieval \nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n261\nprocess is considered to be non-convergent and physical retrieval is assumed to be \nfailed.   \n(ii) Second convergence criteria is based on the brightness temperature residual test. \nThe rms residual is defined by: \n(rn+1)2 = [Ykm – Yk(Xn+1)]2/nch;    \n \n \n \n------- (26) \nWhere k is channel number, nch is total channel used in the iterative procedure. If \nrn+1  rn the iteration continue until rn+1 is acceptably small (less then instrument \nnoise). \nAncillary surface information is used as boundary condition for the profile solutions. The \nsurface air temperature and humidity are treated as additional “channels” to assist the \nbetter retrieval of near surface atmospheric parameters. These surface observations may \nbe within 30 minutes in time and 50 km in space of sounding time/location.

Radiosonde profiles collocated with satellite observations will be generated over \nclear-sky conditions for different regions representing entire variability in atmospheric \nprofiles. These collocated observations will also be used to correct the biases in the \nforward model, and then incorporated in the regression and physical retrieval routines for \naccurate retrievals and convergence. \nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n263\n16.6.1 Radiance bias removal \nAtmospheric profile retrieval is based on modifying the surface temperature and \natmospheric temperature/moisture profiles in a manner such that brightness temperatures \ncalculated agree with those observed from the satellite, within some uncertainty estimate, \nfor the sounding spectral bands.   \nFor INSAT-3D Sounder we begin with a first guess profile, which is a weighted linear \ncombination of profiles obtained from regression retrieval and NWP model forecast, \ninterpolated in time and space to the location of the satellite measurement. The difference \nbetween the observation and the \"forward calculation\" from the first-guess profile \nrepresents the information available in the observation. \nHowever, in practice there are generally bias errors associated with the comparison of \nobservation and the forward calculation. These may be due to calibration error, \nuncertainties in the filter functions, or imprecision in the transmittance model used in the \nforward calculation. Consequently, prior to calculating retrieval, bias error for each band \nis subtracted from the observation. Estimates of the bias error are obtained by examining \nensembles of collocated observations and forward calculations where the atmospheric \nstate is well known (i.e. in the vicinity of radiosondes). \n \n16.6.2 Data Required \nParameter \nSource \nTemperature and humidity profile \nRadiosonde observations, IMD \nOzone profile \nOzonesonde observations, IMD \nSounder Channel Observations collocated \nwith radiosonde observations \nNOAA, EUMETSAT \nSpace and time collocated (within 100 km in space and 3 hours in time) profiles of \ntemperature, humidity and ozone may also be obtained from the various other satellite \nmissions, such as Aqua-AIRS/MODIS/AMSU, Metop-IASI, NOAA-ATOVS/AMSU, etc \nfor the purpose of inter-comparison. \n \n16.6.3 Methods of Validation   \nFrom the observed collocated profiles of temperature, humidity and ozone for clear sky \nconditions, brightness temperatures corresponding to Sounder channels will be computed \nwith the help of fast radiative transfer model used in the physical retrieval routine. The \ncomputed brightness temperatures are analysed with Sounder-observed brightness \ntemperatures to estimate the bias (slope and intercept of the linear regression equation) \nfor each of the sounder channels. These bias-corrections will be implemented in the \nregression and physical retrieval routines to remove the bias between sounder \nobservations and fast RT model computations. \nFor clear sky conditions the observed profiles of temperature, humidity and ozone will be \ninterpolated at the pressure levels of retrieval output (standard 40 pressure levels) and \nroot mean square errors (rmse) from space and time collocated retrieved profiles will be \ncomputed at each vertical pressure levels. Separate statistics may be generated for \nretrievals over land and ocean.  \nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n264\n16.7 \nTechnical Issues \nFinal accuracy of the retrieved profiles will largely depend upon the accuracy of the fast \nradiative transfer model used in the retrieval procedure. Therefore, fast radiative transfer \nmodel needs to be properly validated and the forward model errors should be within \ninstrument noise level.  \nAncillary data improves the quality of sounding retrieval near surface. However, \nsuch observations are very few over Indian region (INSAT-3D viewing region), \ntherefore, the network of the automatic weather stations (AWS) needs to be \nstrengthened.  \nIMD has a network of radiosonde observations over India; however, for INSAT-3D \nvalidation and bias removal procedure highly accurate profiles are required. Therefore, \nfor a limited period of time (6 months after launch), high quality radiosonde (Vaisala) \nobservations should be available over land as well as ocean (special ship cruises) under \nclear sky conditions.  \nCurrently, ozone information is available only from single channel in Sounder, \ntherefore, retrieval of ozone profile may not be very accurate and column integrated \nozone will be more reliable product. \n16.8 \nFuture Scope \nWith the advancement in the spectroscopic measurements of atmospheric gases it is \npossible to make improvement in the radiative transfer model. Improved fast radiative \ntransfer models may be coupled with the physical retrieval routine in future, as and when \navailable. Improvements will also be attempted by incorporating improved training \ndataset in regression retrieval.  \nAnother area for future development is improvement of cloud detection algorithm. This \nmay include synergy of high-resolution Imager data with Sounder observations to detect \nsub-pixel level cloud contamination.  \n Initially, the retrieval will be attempted only over cloud-free FOVs. In future, an \nalgorithm will be developed and implemented with retrieval routine to compute the \ncloud-cleared radiances over partially cloudy pixels.  \nRetrieval of profiles in overcast conditions (valid above cloud top) will also be attempted \nin near future. \nThis algorithm will also be useful for future hyper-spectral missions with suitable \nmodifications.   \n16.9 \nReferences \n1.

Central wavelengths of these channels along with the typical noise \nsensitivity are summarized in the table-1. \nA flat elliptical scan mirror mounted at 45 to the optical axis intercepts the radiation and \nreflects it on to 310mm reflective telescope. At the telescope, dichroic beam splitters \nseparate the visible spectrum and three IR coarse bands. The three IR bands then pass \nthrough the concentric ring of a cold filter wheel maintained at a low temperature (-\n230C) to limit the background radiation. Channel filters on the filter wheel provide \nsequential sampling of defined narrow band spectral channels. There are three concentric \nrings on the filter wheel, each catering to a coarse band. Each of the rings is further \ndivided in to a number of sectors each housing filter for a channel. Detector arrays for \neach coarse band consist of four elements arranged in north-south direction. Thus the \ncombined IFOV of the arrays is 280 (E-W) x 1120 (N-S) R2. The IR detectors are \nmounted inside the radiant cooler and cooled to cryogenic temperature of less than 100K \nfor improving noise performance detectors. The temperature of the detectors is \nmaintained at fixed value using temperature sensors and heaters in a servo-loop. \nThe scan mirror operates in step and dwell mode to facilitate sequential sounding. The \neast-west step size of scan mirror will be 280µR (10km). At each step, the mirror dwells \nfor 0.1 second to allow completion of full spectral coverage through filter wheel drive. \nAfter completing acquiring data in all bands, the mirror steps in north south direction by \n1120 µR (40 km). The rotation of the filter wheel is synchronized to the mirror stepping \nso that the mirror remains stationary during the sounding. To optimize efficiency, both \nforward and reverse scans are used for data collection. In addition to full earth disc \ncoverage, flexible programme modes are provided to cater to different coverage \nrequirements based on dynamics of atmospheric environment. The scan mirror traverses \nto the space-look position to get cold reference for the IR detectors. The interval between \ntwo space-looks is of the order of one minute. The space-look periodicity is decided \nbased on the estimate of the interval required for maintaining stable background and \ntemperature of the IR detector so that the space-look data remains valid during this \nperiod. It is proposed to have a provision within the scan mechanism to accept motion \ncompensation signal from AOCS to compensate for the various spacecraft rates, orbit \nperturbations and effect of the imager mirror slew on the spacecraft. Four detectors per \ncoarse band in north-south direction will generate four soundings per channel for every \nstep and dwell interval of 0.1 second through a complete rotation of the filter-wheel. Thus \nthere are a total of sixteen detectors in the instrument, twelve for IR sounding channels \nand four for visible channel.  \nThe normal mode of Sounder operation covers 6000km x 6000km field of view and takes \napproximately 160 minutes. In addition, the instrument is designed with flexible modes \nof operation for fast and repetitive coverage.  \nThe cold space view is used for signal referencing and as a calibration point for all bands. \nIn-orbit multipoint calibration of the IR channel is carried out through viewing of full \nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n269\naperture high emissivity internal cavity, whose physical temperature is accurately \nmonitored at multiple locations and transmitted in Sounder data stream.  \n \nThe detector outputs are individually amplified, integrated in synchronism with the filter \nwheel movement and digitized to twelve bits by A/D converter. The digitized data along \nwith house keeping and calibration information is formatted, randomized and sent to \ntransmitter as a serial data stream. The data rate is approximately 40 Kbps. \nThe temperature control of the IR detector mounted on cooled patch as well as that of \nfilter wheel will be achieved through proportional controller. \n \nTable 2: INSAT-3D Sounder Channels Characteristics \nDetector \nCh. \nNo. \n c \n(m) \nc\n(cm-1) \n\nm (cm-1)\nPrincipal \nabsorbing gas \nPurpose \nLong wave \n1 \n14.67 \n682 \n0.385 (18) \nCO2 \nStratosphere temperature \n2 \n14.31 \n699 \n0.305 (15) \nCO2 \nTropopause temperature \n3 \n14.03 \n713 \n0.321 (16) \nCO2 \nUpper-level temperature \n4 \n13.64 \n733 \n0.351 (19) \nCO2 \nMid-level temperature \n5 \n13.33 \n750 \n0.352 (20) \nCO2 \nLow-level temperature \n6 \n12.59 \n794 \n0.541 (34) \nwater vapor \nTotal precipitable water \n7 \n11.98 \n834 \n0.768 (53) \nwater vapor \nSurface temp., moisture \nMid wave \n8 \n10.99 \n910 \n0.611 (51) \nwindow \nSurface temperature \n9 \n9.69 \n1032 \n0.262 (28) \nozone \nTotal ozone \n10 \n7.43 \n1346 \n0.299 (54) \nwater vapor \nLow-level moisture \n11 \n7.04 \n1421 \n0.426 (86) \nwater vapor \nMid-level moisture \n12 \n6.52 \n1534 \n0.269 (63) \nwater vapor \nUpper-level moisture \nShort wave \n13 \n4.61 \n2168 \n0.054 (25) \nN2O \nLow-level temperature \n14 \n4.54 \n2202 \n0.053 (26) \nN2O \nMid-level temperature \n15 \n4.48 \n2232 \n0.057 (28) \nCO2 \nUpper-level temperature \n16 \n4.15 \n2408 \n0.078 (45) \nCO2 \nBoundary-level temp. \n17 \n4.01 \n2496 \n0.075 (46) \nwindow \nSurface temperature \n18 \n3.79 \n2642 \n0.143 (100) \nwindow \nSurface temp., moisture \n \nLand surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n270\nLand surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n271\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n17.

However, the upcoming INSAT-3D data with \nimproved spatial and temporal resolution can be used for near real time detection and \nmapping of fog. \nThe detection of fog/low stratus with satellite data has been taken up since many years \n(Bendix 2002. The general methodology of fog detection involves identification of some \nthreshold radiances or brightness temperature at different wavelengths. Fog is formed \nwhen vapor in the lower atmosphere condensed in cold conditions. The fog droplets are \nmuch smaller than the cloud droplet. The presence of these droplets affects the \natmospheric visibility. The radiation difference between the cloud and fog is due to the \nspectral response differences of every channel. This provides the basis of fog detection. \n \n17.2.2 Objective \n \nTo identify the presence of fog from INSAT-3D data \n17.3  Inputs \nThe following table gives a list of inputs required for algorithm input and calibration \n \n17.3.1 Static Data \n \nData \nResolution \nUnit \nSource \nSurface \nelevation \nabove mean sea level \nPixel level \n \nmeters \nUSGS or other gridded data \navailable on internet. \nLand surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n274\n17.3.2 Image and Calibration Inputs \n \nParameter \nResolution \nQuantization \nAccuracy \nSource \nRadiometric and \ngeometric corrected \ngray count values \nof VIS channel (6.5) \npixel \n10 bit \n-- \nDerived from \nraw data by \nDP (data \nprocessing) \nRadiometric and \ngeometric corrected \ngray count values \nof MIR channel (3.9) \npixel \n10 bit \n-- \nDerived from \nraw data by \nDP (data \nprocessing) \nRadiometric and \ngeometric corrected \ngray count values \nof TIR-I channel \n(10.5) \npixel \n10 bit \n- \nDerived from \nraw data by \nDP \nGray value to \nbrightness \ntemperature (MIR, \nTIR-1) conversion \ntable \n- \n- \n0.3 K \nDerived by \nDP \nGray value to albedo \n(VIS) conversion \ntable \n- \n- \n0.3 K \nDerived by \nDP \nGeolocation file \nPixel \n- \n1 pixel \nDerived by \nDP \n \n17.3.3 Other Auxillary data  \n \nParameter \nResolution \nQuantization \nAccuracy \nSource \nSolar Zenith Angle \npixel \n- \n-- \nDerived by DP  \nSatellite Zenith \nAngle \npixel \n- \n-- \nDerived by DP  \nAzimuth Angle \npixel \n- \n- \nDerived by DP \nSnow Map \npixel \n- \n- \nDerived under \nIMDPS \nLand surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n275\n17.4  Algorithm Functional Specifications \n \n17.4.1 Overview \n \n17.4.1.1 Theoretical Background \n \nNight Time Fog Detection \nThe difference of brightness temperature corresponding to two spectral channels (3.9 and \n10.8m) is used for the identification of fog. The theoretical basis for the detection of fog \nusing 3.9m and ~11 m channels rely on the particular emissivity properties for fog \ndroplets (Bendix and Bechmann, 1991) in these two channels. The small droplets found \nin fog are less emissive at 3.9 m than at ~11m whereas emissivities are roughly same \nfor larger droplets (Hunt, 1973) in both the channels. The difference between brightness \ntemperatures measured at different wavelength is tested against a threshold value and \nattributed to the categories of clear/ fog/other clouds etc.. The difference in brightness \ntemperature values below 0.5 K is assumed to be cloud free and above 2.5 K is \nrepresented as opaque clouds (Ellord, 1995). However, a threshold of 5.5 K to 7.0 K has \nbeen observed for fog developed over the Indo Gangetic plains of India (Chaurasia et al, \n2011) ranging from thin to thick fog case using MODIS data. This threshold will change \nwith spatial and spectral resolution of the satellite data used for the detection of fog. \nApart from this it also varies from time to time as well as from place to place and types of \nfog. \n \nFlowchart for nighttime fog detection \n \nFog\nTB > TB min\n \nLand surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n276\nDay Time Fog Detection \nThe basis of the algorithm is a gross cloud check.  This test is based on the assumption \nthat the brightness temperature of high clouds are very low (<270 0K) and the brightness \ntemperature of fog lies between that of land (very high brightness temperature) and high \nclouds during day time. The high cloud regions are eliminated by using a threshold of brightness temperature of 10.8 m channel. This threshold is determined dynamically.\n \n \nOnce the region is classified as foggy, the day time detection algorithm is used. The day \ntime algorithm of fog detection is based on the temporal differencing technique (Paul \nd’Entremont and Gustafson, 2003) which is used operationally to monitor cloud using \ngeostationary data. In this method apart from using thermal channel like TIR1 channel of \nINSAT-3D for cloud detection, the visible channel (0.55-0.75 m) is also used. The \ndroplet size of fog being close to the wavelength of visible and infrared radiation, fog has \nprominent scattering effect.  Thus the visible channel plays an important role in detecting \nday time fog. \n \n17.4.1.2 Flow chart for day time fog detection \n \nGross Cloud Check \nNot a Cloud\nCloud\nGeneration of \ncloud free image \nusing past 10/15 \nday data\nCloudy/Foggy Data\nTemporal Differencing Technique\nSurface Elevation test\nFog/ \nLow \nStratus\nElimination of snow pixel\nImager Data\nCoversion from DN to \nReflectance/ BT\nHomogeneity Test\n \n \n17.4.2 Operational Implementation \n \nNight Time Fog Detection \n \n17.4.2.1 Selection of night time data only by using information of solar zenith angle and \nvisible count \n17.4.2.2 Conversion of grey count to brightness temperature \nLand surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n277\n17.4.2.3 Gross cloud testing using 10.8 μm brightness temperature  \n17.4.2.4 High cloud elimination by using  10.8 μm brightness temperature threshold \n17.4.2.5 Removal of remaining snow pixel by using 10.8 μm brightness temperature \nthresholding \n17.4.2.6 Difference between 10.8 and 3.9 m channel brightness temperatures. \n  \n \n17.4.2.7 Fog detection  \n(The minimum value of brightness temperature difference ΔTBmin above which \nthe pixel is flagged to be fog is determined dynamically.

It is needed as an input to a \nvariety of climatic, ecological, hydrological and biogeochemical studies. Retrieval of \nLST from the Earth observation satellite is quite challenging since the land surface is \nlaterally inhomogeneous and is composed of various materials with different geometries. \nSurface temperatures are derived from satellite based measurements in the thermal \ninfrared (TIR) window channels using either empirical method or physical algorithm. \nA number of Earth observation satellites such as EOS-MODIS, ASTER, AATSR, \nNOAA-AVHRR, Landsat ETM+, GOES-8, GOES-R, MSG-SEVIRI etc have TIR \nchannels to derive LST. Various algorithms and coefficients have been developed for \nLST retrieval for these systems and reported in the literature over a period of time \n(Ulivieri et al., 1994, Wan and Dozier, 1996, Sobrino et al., 2000, Sun and Pinker, 2003, \nSobrino et al., 2004, Kerr et al., 2004, Sòria and Sobrino, 2007, Sun and Pinker, 2007, \nYu et al., 2009). \nIndian Earth observation satellites such as INSAT-2E, Kalpana-1, INSAT-3A and \nINSAT-3D have also TIR channels for surface temperature retrieval purpose. However, \nlittle attention has been paid to develop the method for estimating LST from Indian \nsensors. A Single Channel (SC) algorithm for retrieving LST from the thermal channel \n(10.5-12.5 µm) of Kalpana-1 (K1) VHRR sensor was developed over India using a \nradiative transfer model (Pandya et al., 2010, Pandya et al., 2013). In order to exploit the \npresence of two TIR channels in the INSAT-3D Imager sensor for better estimation of \nLST, a study has been taken up to develop a method to retrieve LST through a split-\nwindow (SW) algorithm.  \nObjective of the present work is to develop an algorithm to retrieve LST using two TIR \nchannels of the Imager sensor onboard INSAT-3D satellite using a radiative transfer (RT) \nmodel over India. Study also presents the comparison of INSAT-3D LST to the \ncontemporaneous LST products available from the MODIS and K1 satellites. \nLand surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n284\n18.2.2 Imager sensor onboard INSAT-3D \nINSAT-3D is the new generation Indian Earth observation satellite launched by ISRO on \nJuly 26, 2013. It provides enhanced observations of land, ocean and atmosphere through \ntwo payloads namely Imager and Sounder from the geostationary orbit. The Imager \npayload is designed to sense solar-reflected and radiant energy from the Earth through six \nchannels covering visible (VIS: 0.55-0.75 m), shortwave infrared (SWIR: 1.55-1.70 \nm), middle infrared (MIR: 3.8-4.0 m), water vapor infrared (WVIR: 6.5-7.1 m) and \nthermal infrared (TIR1: 10.3-11.3 m and TIR2: 11.5-12.5 m) spectral regions of \nelectromagnetic spectrum having varying spatial resolution ranging from 1 km to 8 km \n(CDR, 2009).

View zenith angle for the INSAT-3D satellite located at 84 degree E \n \nTo derive LST from various satellite-based sensors several types of split-window (SW) \nalgorithms have been developed during past three decades; however, SW algorithm for \nIndian sensor has not been attempted. This document presents a theoretical base study \nthat was carried out to develop a SW algorithm for LST retrieval using TIR observations \nfrom the INSAT-3D Imager. \n18.3 \nTHEORETICAL BACKGROUND \n \nThermal infrared signal received by satellite sensors is combination of three parameters, \nnamely; (1) surface temperature and surface emissivity, (2) atmospheric emission, \nabsorption and scattering acting upon thermal radiation from the surface, and (3) the solar \nradiation during daytime. In the absence of atmosphere, estimation of LST of the Earth’s \nsurface would be much simpler task. On the other hand, the presence of Earth’s \natmosphere between the satellite and the surface changes the surface emitted radiances \nmeasured by the satellite sensor in several ways, making LST retrieval from satellite \nbased platform a complex task (Dash et al. 2002).  \nThe transmission of the surface emitted radiance through the atmosphere to the satellite, \nand its interaction with the active elements of the atmosphere is expressed as Radiative \nTransfer Equation (RTE) (Dash et al. 2002). \n \n \nWhere, \nLand surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n286\n \n = the radiance measured by the satellite based sensor (W/m2.sr.µm), \n = the at-sensor brightness temperature (K) \n = the surface emissivity \n = Planck radiance at surface temperature \n \n = atmospheric transmittance \n = upwelling path radiance \n = downwelling sky radiance at Earth’s surface \n \nThe first term stands for the surface-emitted radiance after being attenuated by the \natmosphere, second term corresponds to the upwelling sky radiance emitted by the \natmosphere towards the sensor, and last term represents the downwelling radiation \nreaching the sensor after being reflected from the Earth’s surface. Here all the quantities \nrefer to a spectral integration over the bandwidth of channel i and depend on the view \nzenith angle. \nThe Planck radiance Bi(Ts) is expressed as, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n.\n)\n(\n2\n5\n1\ns\niT\nc\ni\ns\ni\ne\nc\nT\nB\n\n\n                 (2) \nwith c1 and c2 being the Planck’s radiation constants, with values of 1.19104.108 \nW.m4.m-2.sr-1 and 14387.7 m.K, respectively. \n \nInverting Eq. (1) we get, \n \n \nIn this problem, the surface temperature is basically coupled with two factors: the surface \nemissivity and the atmospheric absorptions. Developing an LST algorithm means to find \na solution of decoupling the emissivity and the atmospheric absorption effects from the \nsatellite measured radiance. The surface temperature Ts can be obtained from Eq. 1 and 2 \nby correcting the atmospheric and emissivity effects and then by calculating Ts by \ninversion of the Planck’s law. However, atmospheric correction of TIR radiances is the \nmost difficult part (Liang, 2004). The use of SW algorithm avoids the atmospheric \ncorrection issue. This method uses two thermal bands typically located in the atmospheric \nwindow between 10.5-12.5 m. The basis of the technique is that the radiance attenuation \nfor atmospheric absorption is proportional to the radiance difference of simultaneous \nmeasurements at two different wavelengths, each subject to different amounts of \natmospheric absorption. Actually SW algorithm provides atmospheric correction of a \nbrightness temperature measurement in one spectral band (typically cantered around 11 \nm) given a brightness temperature measurement in a second “spectrally-close” band \n(typically cantered around 12 m) (figure 3). They exploit the differential absorption \ntendency of two neighbouring spectral bands due to various gases. To estimate LST from \nsatellite observations, most SW algorithms are derived from a first-order Taylor-series \nlinearization of the RT equation in long-wave infrared spectral bands (Yu, 2009).  \nLand surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n287\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\nWavelength in micrometer\nTransmittance\n0.1 g/cm2\n3.0 g/cm2\n6.0 g/cm2\nMIR\nWVIR\nTIR1\nTIR2\n \nFigure 3: Atmospheric transmission computed for different atmospheric water vapour \ncontent using the MODTRAN model for nadir observations with surface temperature of \n305K.

In most cases, \nthe SW LST algorithms simultaneously convert brightness temperature to skin \ntemperature, given the estimates of the surface spectral emissivity. A review of the SW \ntechnique and published SW algorithms can be found in Li et al., (2013). The SW \nalgorithm selected and proposed for this study is given by (Li et al., 2013; Sobrino et al., \n1994) equation (4) and it is modified in the present study for varying view zenith angles \nfor the Imager sensor (section 3.1), \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\na\na\nT\nT\na\nT\nT\na\nT\na\na\nT\nj\ni\nj\ni\ni\ns\n.\n1\n.\n.\n.\n.\n6\n5\n2\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      (4) \n \nWhere Ti and Tj are the at-sensor brightness temperatures at the SW bands i and j (in \nKelvin),  is the mean emissivity, j),  is the emissivity difference,  \n=(j) and a1 to a6 are the SW coefficients to be determined from simulation data.  \n18.4 \nMethod and Data Used in the Study \n \n18.4.1 Methodology \nA flowchart depicting the steps followed in the proposed algorithm is shown in the figure \n4. The split-window algorithm requires a forward simulation study for generating split-\nwindow coefficients through the RT model using various inputs (details discussed in the \nnext sections). With the use of these split-window coefficients and emissivity information, \nthe radiance observed at the top-of-atmosphere by the INSAT-3D Imager sensor is \nconverted into the LST. The LST images generated from the INSAT-3D Imager sensor \ncan then be compared with (a) K1-LST products available on MOSDAC archival system \nand (b) MODIS LST products available through the NASA’s archival system. The \nindividual components of this flowchart have been discussed in details in the following \nsub-sections. \nLand surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n288\n3D-Imager data: TIR1, 2\nTOA Radiance, Lsen\nBrightness T, TB\nSplit Window \nMethod\nLST Image\nPlanck’s  function\n, Lp, Lsen, TB\nForward modeling\nSplit Window \nCoeff: a0 to a6\nRT Model\nSpectra\nVarious class\nAtmo.profiles\nT, P, W V..\nLST range\nSensor: SRF\nImage\nSatellite Products \nMODIS/INSAT\nCloud mask\nValidation\nView zenith \nangle\n \nFigure 4: Flowchart showing steps to be followed for retrieval of LST from Imager data \n \n18.4.1.1 \nSplit-window method \nAs discussed in the above section, the basis of SW technique is that the atmospheric \nattenuation suffered by the surface emitted radiance is proportional to the difference \nbetween at-sensor radiances measured simultaneously in two different thermal channels.  \nMany types of the SW algorithms have been developed for the LST retrieval. In an earlier \nanalysis reported in a paper (Pandya et al., 2011b), various SW algorithms were \nevaluated for LST retrieval from the INSAT-3D Imager sensor. Ten different published \nSW algorithms (or their slight variants) from the literature were evaluated and compared \nin the study and the following suitable form of algorithm (Eq. 3) was selected for the \nImager sensor. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\na\na\nT\nT\na\nT\nT\na\nT\na\na\nT\nj\ni\nj\ni\ni\ns\n.\n1\n.\n.\n.\n.\n6\n5\n2\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThis SW expression was then modified from the original formulation for having \nimproved results for correcting path length variation due to high view zenith angle \nimaging in the case of Imager sensor from the geostationary orbit as described in the \nfollowing sub-section.  \n18.4.1.2 \nModification of split-window method: Correcting for Path Angle \nVariability  \nAs shown in figure 2, the Imager sensor has wide field of view. McClain et al. (1985) \nfirst pointed out that, at high viewing angles, atmospheric absorption is amplified. \nLand surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n289\nGeometric analysis shows that the atmospheric path length at the sensor’s edge-of-scan \n(for view zenith angle ~65 degree) is at least 2.5 times higher than at nadir. Pandya et al. \n(2011a) have also shown that at-sensor radiance value observed by the Imager sensor \nreduces with increasing view zenith angle by an amount of 7 to 8 percent for 300 K target. \nThis has a significant effect on the satellite measured brightness temperature. For a target \non the ground having 300 K temperature and 0.98 emissivity with average atmospheric \nwater vapor of 1.5 g/cm2, the at-sensor brightness temperature varies between 297.2 K to \n295.5 K for atmospheric path length changing from 1 to 2 corresponding to view zenith \nangle varying between 0 to 60 degree (figure 5). If a SW algorithm’s coefficients are \ndetermined for the nadir case, then use of same coefficients for all the view angles can \nsignificantly degrade the algorithm accuracy at large view angles. The standard MODIS \nalgorithm addressed this problem (Wan & Dozier, 1996). Here, in the case of Imager \nsensor the view zenith angle can vary nominally up to 50 degree, so we intend to generate \na unique set of split-window coefficients for each view angle sub-ranges (e.g., 00–200, \n200–300300–350, 350–400, 400–450, 450–500 and 500–550). \n295.2\n295.6\n296\n296.4\n296.8\n297.2\n0\n20\n40\n60\nBrightness temperature, 10.3-11.3 um band\nView zenith angle, degree\n \nFigure 5. Effect of view zenith angle on the temperature observed at satellite level \n18.4.2 Model used \nThe satellite level signal in the TIR channels of Imager sensor was simulated using a RT \nmodel – MODTRAN (MODerate spectral resolution atmospheric TRANSmittance) \nversion 4.0. The MODTRAN (Berk et al. 1999) was selected for the study because this \nmodel has been long publicly available and its heritage traces back to LOWTRAN \n(Kneizys et al. 1988). It is widely used and validated model for variety of remote sensing \nanalysis and applications across the globe. It uses a more accurate and higher resolution \nmolecular band model based on the Atlas of High Resolution Molecular Spectroscopic \ndata (HITRAN) molecular database. With its spectral resolution capability of 2 cm−1, this \nnarrowband model can perform calculations very accurately with less input requirements \nas discussed by Lacis and Oinas (1991) and Liang (2004). They have shown that using \ntwo narrow spectral ranges of H2O and CO2 (for a resolution of 10 cm−1, and for total gas \npressures above 0.1 atm), the correlation accuracy can be improved to better than 1%. \nWith its spectral resolution capability of cm-1 in frequency it simulates at-sensor radiance \nand transmittance as a function of: atmospheric inputs (model atmosphere, atmospheric \nLand surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n290\ncolumn parameters, aerosol model etc), surface inputs (emissivity, temperature), viewing \ngeometry and information on spectral channels. \n \n18.4.3 Data used in the study \nVarious data sets have been used in the present study for generation and validation of \nLST from the INSAT-3D Imager data. This includes the raw Imager data sets (at-sensor \nbrightness temperature, latitude-longitude layers), MODIS emissivity products in two \nspectral channels, K1-LST products and MODIS-LST products. The K1-LST and \nMODIS-LST products were used for comparing the LST images being generated from \nthe INSAT-3D Imager sensor using the proposed method.

(2) \nAtmospheric column water vapour: The water vapour values ranging from 0.1 g/cm2 to \nnear saturated level have been used through each atmospheric profile. (3) Surface \ntemperature: The land surface temperature ranging from 260-330 K has been taken \nkeeping tropical region as the context. (4) View zenith angle (VZA): 0 to 60 degree. (5) \nLand surface emissivity:  Emissivity values from the standard International Geosphere \nBiosphere Program (IGBP) land cover types, major 10 major land cover types (ocean \nwater, snow, sand, crop, shrubs, grass, forest, savanna, wetland, urban) have been \nconsidered from the MODTRAN database.  \nLand surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n291\nA set of radiosonde and satellite sounder profiles over tropical region from the SeeBor \ndataset (Borbas et al. 2005; Seeman et al. 2008) is selected for input in MODTRAN \nsimulations. Figure 6 shows a graph of atmospheric profiles covering the boundary layer \natmospheric temperature from 257.4 to 315.3 K and water vapour concentration from 0.1 \nto 5 g/cm2 selected in the present study. Synthetic profiles were also generated from these \nbasic profiles by modulating the surface temperature by ±10 degree. The attenuation due \nto atmosphere has been considered because of uniformly mixed gases, namely, CO2, N2O, \nO3 and CH4 along with the water vapour in the MODTRAN forward simulations. The \ncontribution due to solar radiation in the MIR channel is not considered in the simulations. \nAll the transmittance and path radiance calculations were performed in the Imager \nthermal IR spectral channels by incorporating the spectral response function (figure 1) of \nthe respective spectral channel. \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n250\n260\n270\n280\n290\n300\n310\n320\nColumnar Water Vapour, g/cm2\nBoundary Layer Temperature, K\n \nFigure 6.

Specifically, the relationship between the model input LST and \noutput top-of-atmosphere (TOA) brightness temperature is fit with an LST algorithm \n(equation 4) via regression to obtain the required coefficients.  \n18.5 \nResults \n18.5.1 Derivation of Split-Window Coefficients (SWC) \nThe satellite-level signals in two TIR channels pertaining to Imager sensor were \nsimulated for varying atmospheric and land surface properties discussed in the above \nsections. In order to determine the SWC a0 to a6 in Eq. (4), we divided the VZA into \nseveral tractable sub-ranges for improving the fitting accuracy and thus LST retrievals. \nSimulations were performed for VZA ranging from 0 to 60 degree taking into account the \nfact that the Imager sensor onboard INSAT-3D receives radiance from various VZA \nhaving varying atmospheric path length. The SW coefficients (a1 to a6) of Eq. (4) can be \nobtained through statistical regressions method for each VZA sub-range.  Seven different \nsets of SWC were determined for each of this VZA sub-ranges, which are summarized in \nthe table 3 and shown in the figure 8. \nTable 3.

(5-7) to each of the thousands of simulated data points.  \n \nTable 4: Results obtained in the sensitivity analysis \nView angle \nSub range \nalg (K) \nNET (K) \n (K) \ne(LST) (K) \n0 \n0.68 \n0.32 \n0.32 \n0.82 \n30 \n0.82 \n0.33 \n0.32 \n0.94 \n35 \n0.89 \n0.33 \n0.30 \n1.00 \n40 \n0.98 \n0.34 \n0.30 \n1.07 \n45 \n1.10 \n0.34 \n0.30 \n1.19 \n50 \n1.30 \n0.35 \n0.29 \n1.38 \n55 \n1.52 \n0.37 \n0.28 \n1.59 \nAverage \n1.04 \n0.34 \n0.30 \n1.14 \nGenerally, the accuracy of the SW algorithm is ensured by the standard error of the \nalgorithm (alg). In this study, the alg values ranged between 0.68 to 1.52 K. An increase \nin the algorithm error was observed as view angle varied from lower to higher values. In \nterms of different contributions to e(LST), it is clearly seen that the less contribution is \ndue to the  uncertainty, with  values ranging between 0.28 to 0.32 K. The NET ranged \nbetween 0.32 and 0.37 K. In terms of total errors on LST, e(LST), values ranged between \n0.82 K to 1.59 K, with an average error of 1.14 K. Looking at the analysis and results \nsummarized in table 3, it is clear that the proposed SW algorithm performs best with \noverall error of 1 K when view angles vary between 0 to 35 degree. Since major of the \nIndian landmass is covered with the view angle up to 35 degree by the INSAT-3D \nImager (figure 2), we expect to obtain overall modeling error less than 1 K. \n18.5.3 Application of LST algorithm to INSAT-3D Imager data \nA total of 40 raw images of INSAT-3D Imager sensor for every half an hour time period \nof 29th Nov. 2013 were obtained for the analysis. From the raw h5 images, the top-of-\natmosphere (TOA) radiance data corresponding to two split-window channels (TIR1 and \nTIR2) and latitude-longitude layers were extracted from it.  The TOA radiance data were \nconverted to the brightness temperature values using the calibration coefficients provided \nin form of look-up-table. Then these brightness temperature layers of two split-window \nchannels were geo-referenced using the latitude and longitude datasets. An example of \nImager standard false colour composite for a daytime (05:30 GMT) is shown in the figure \n9.  \nLand surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n295\n \nFigure 9. Image composite generated from INSAT-3D Imager data using the combination \nof TIR1, TIR1 and TIR2 channels for Nov. 29, 2013 (05:30 GMT) \n \nNow the TOA brightness temperature images corresponding to the split-window channels \nwere converted into the LST values using the SWC and proposed method. Here a \nparticular set of SWC was used in the SW algorithm depending upon a VZA sub-range, \ni.e. a unique set of SWC was applied for each of the seven VZA sub-ranges. Figure 10 \nshows an example of LST image generated by the proposed method.  The LST image \nshown here has been generated by the SW method along with the known emissivity \nvalues generated over India with the help of approximately 20 emissivity tiles of MODIS. \nThe LST products have been generated with a typical spatial resolution of 4 km. A \nspecific land-sea mask was applied to obtain only the landmass covered within the image. \nThe cloudy pixels in the LST products are not masked out in the initial stage. The cloud \nmasking was done in later part of the analysis based upon a bi-spectral thresholding \nmethod and an example of such LST image is shown in figure 11. To demonstrate the \napplicability of our SW method, all 40 images were converted to the LST and for detailed \nanalysis and validation, three images were selected corresponding to daytime (05:30 and \n09:00 GMT) and night time (21:00 GMT) of 29th Nov. 2013 over India. \nLand surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n296\n250    260    270    275     279   283    287   291    295    299    303    307    311    315    319    323     327    331    335     340\nK\nNo data\n \nFigure 10: Land surface temperature derived with the proposed split-window method for \nINSAT-3D Imager for Nov. 29, 2013 (05:30 GMT) without cloud mask \n \n250    260    270    275     279   283    287   291    295    299    303    307    311    315    319    323     327    331    335     340\nK\nNo data\n \nFigure 11: Land surface temperature derived with the proposed split-window method for \nINSAT-3D Imager for Nov. 29, 2013 (05:30 GMT) with cloud mask \n \nLand surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n297\n18.5.4 Generation of LST products on diurnal scale \nThis section presents results on the generation of LST products on the diurnal scale over \nIndia and surrounding region. Examples of the 3D-LST images are shown in the figure \n12 for diurnal images acquired on Nov. 29, 2013. The 3D-LST images suggest that LST \nvalues were captured successfully, which ranged from 275-320 K over the Indian region \nfor this particular day.  \n00:30\n02:30\n04:30\n06:30\n08:30\n10:30\n12:30\n14:30\n16:30\n20:30\n22:30\n23:30\n250    260    270    275     279   283    287   291    295    299    303    307    311    315    319    323     327    331    335     340\nK\nNo data\n \nFigure 12. Diurnal LST images generated using a split-window method from INSAT-3D \nImager data over India for Nov. 29, 2013 \nAs expected, higher temperatures during daytime were observed mostly in the western \narid and semi-arid regions of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra states of India as well \nas major portion of neighbouring countries having arid regions located in the west of \nIndia. While lower temperatures were observed in the northern parts of India, which are \nLand surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n298\nwere dominated by the winter crop regions. An analysis was carried out to obtain diurnal \ncycle of typical land covers in the LST profiles. The idea behind generation of LST on \nthis scale is to check whether the model physics works well throughout the day or not. \nThe diurnal patterns of LST over different land covers such as desert, shrub and crop are \nshown in the figure 13. The patterns resemble to the known behaviour of the LST on \nthese land covers, which confirms that proposed SW method is working well over full \nday-night cycle.  \n275\n280\n285\n290\n295\n300\n305\n310\n315\n320\n00:30\n02:00\n03:30\n05:00\n06:30\n08:00\n09:30\n11:00\n12:30\n14:00\n15:30\n20:30\n22:00\n23:30\nINSAT-3D Land Surface Temperature, K\nTIME (hh:mm), GMT\nDesert\nShrubland\nCropland1\nCropland2\n \nFigure 13.

The comparison of \ndaytime and nighttime retrievals shows (figure 14, 17 and 20) that the LST values from \n3D fairly match with MODIS as well as K1 sensors. The comparison showed a good \ncorrelation having R2 values varying from 0.73 (05:30 GMT), 0.66 (09:00 GMT) and \n0.79 (21:00 GMT) for 3D Vs. MODIS and from 0.81 (05:30 GMT), 0.80 (09:00 GMT) \nand 0.51 (21:00 GMT) for 3D Vs. K1. While, the standard error of estimates (SEE) \nobserved between 3D and MODIS were 1.84 K (05:30 GMT), 2.27K (09:00 GMT) and \n1.37 K (21:00 GMT). And the SEE observed between 3D and K1 were 1.24 K (05:30 \nGMT), 1.37K (09:00 GMT) and 1.10 K (21:00 GMT). It is clear that nighttime retrievals \nshowed an excellent match when the LST ranged between 280 to 300 (figure 21). \nHowever, for the daytime satellite-passes when temperatures were generally more than \n300 K in this part of the globe, 3D-LST showed a deviation as compared to the MOD-\nLST (figure 15 and 18). In the case of satellite pass of 05:30 GMT, the 3D-LST \ndemonstrated a moderate deviation with SEE=1.84 K (R2=0.73) as compared to the \nMOD-LST (figure 15). While 09:00 GMT satellite pass showed a slightly high degree of \ndeviation (SEE=2.27 K, R2=0.66) (figure 18). \nOverall the 3D-LST values showed a good match with the reference LST values in the \nrange of 270-310 K, demonstrating that the SW algorithm is working fairly well. \nHowever, for some of the daytime 3D-LST retrievals (e.g. 05:30 GMT), an unambiguous \nover estimation was observed as compared to MOD-LST retrievals. This overestimation \nin 3D-LST is apparent at all the LST values independent of low or high values in the \ndaytime. Reasons of this overestimation in 3D LST could be: use of India-specific \natmospheric profiles in present study for the RT modelling to obtain better tuning of the \nSW coefficients, difference in the algorithms used, difference in the spatial resolution, \ndifference in time of data acquisition, ignorance of the reflectance term (3rd term of \nequation 1) in the simulation of at-sensor radiance. This reflectance term is quite small \nsince it is multiplied with the downwelling radiance, atmospheric transmittivity and (1-\nemissivity) components. But probably with the presence of solar radiation it may play an \nimportant role, which has to be checked in future analysis.  Moreover, there are certain \nissues like cloud masking remain in the present LST retrieval. At many instances in the \npresent analysis, thresholding method for cloud masking does not perform well especially \nover snow regions. A robust cloud-mask algorithm has to be devised and applied to get \naccurate LST products. \n18.7 \nConclusions \nThis document presents results of a study to develop a method to generate LST product \nfrom the thermal infrared channels of INSAT-3D Imager sensor over India using a RT \nmodel. A modified split-window algorithm including the view angle correction was \ndeveloped specifically tuned for the Imager sensor. Simulations were carried out based \nupon a number of model inputs to derive a set of coefficients from the atmospheric \nfunctions particularly tuned for the Imager sensor. These SW coefficients were then used \nto generate the LST product. The total theoretical modelling error ranged from 0.8 K (for \nview zenith angle equal to 0 degree) to 1.6 K (for view zenith angle equal to 55 degree) \nwith an average error of 1.1 K. The LST derived using the proposed method was \nvalidated with the Kalpana-1 VHRR LST and MODIS LST products for day and night \nLand surface temperature \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n303\ndatasets. This inter-comparison brought out the fact that the proposed algorithm provided \nencouraging results with a very good match of 3D-LST with other reference LST \nestimates. The comparison of satellite derived LST with other two satellite observations \nover India showed a fairly good agreement between satellite estimates, with a R2 value \nup to 0.79 and RMSE of 1.37 K for 3D Vs. MODIS comparison, while a R2 value up to \n0.81 and RMSE of 1.1 K for 3D Vs. K1 comparison. The overestimation in the case of \ndaytime observations in the 3D LST is to be explored in the future. A robust cloud \nremoval algorithm has to be developed and applied on the LST images. The method \ndeveloped in this report provides a theoretical base for generation of operational LST \nproducts over India from the INSAT-3D Imager data. \nAcknowledgement \nThis study has been carried out under the INSAT-3D Utilization Project “Retrieval of \nland surface temperature from the INSAT-3D Imager observations”.

One of the distinguishing factors of ET is its role as a key player between \nthe energy and water cycles. The potential ET rate (ETo) is influenced by several factors \nsuch as solar radiation, wind speed, air temperature and vapour pressure deficit. Among \nthem, solar radiation is the most sensitive parameter influencing almost 60-70% \nvariability of ETo . The potential evapo-transpiration (PET), hereafter referred as grass \nreference evapo-transpiration (ETo), is expressed in terms of amount of water transferred \nper unit time to atmosphere from water non-limiting surface covered with a uniformly \nand actively growing short grass such as Alfalfa. ETo represents the evaporative demand \nof the atmosphere for a given climatic region. Deficiency in required supply of moisture \nleads to water stress. Reference evapo-transpiration is an agrometeorological variable \nwidely used in hydrology and agriculture. Together with precipitation, it is a major input \nin soil water balance models. Several of these models require daily or hourly evapo-\ntranspiration data to provide acceptable estimate of plants’ water requirements. This \nwould provide regional water demand in different agro-climatic settings and agricultural \ngrowing season. The combination of spatial rainfall with ETo would help in monitoring \nwater deficit and surplus during a growing season for rainfed agriculture. \nSome contours of monthly climatic ETo have been generated by Department of \nAgricultural Meteorology, IMD (India Meteorological Department) from measurements \nof limited surface observatories in India. But interpolation from such contours will \npropagate large errors. No digital map of ETo is available to scientific community, \nmodelers, resource managers and planners in India. Moreover, real-time updated spatial \nETo product at weekly, ten-day, fortnightly and monthly scales would aid in knowing the \nintra and inter-seasonal climatic variability of water stress factors and their impact on \ndeviation in biomass and yield. The climatic moisture index (ratio of rainfall and PET) is \nessential to know surface wetness and suitability of sowing or transplanting operations. \nPotential evapotranspiration \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n310\nTherefore, it has the relevance for national agro-advisory services to farmers as well as \ncrop forecasting. \n19.2.1 Overview and background \nThe latent heat of vaporization, which is the energy required for evaporating water is \nsignificant in weather and climate dynamics (Priestley & Taylor, 1972; Monteith,1973; \nRowntree, 1991; Anderson et al., 2007). Although the concept of “evaporation” has been \nknown since approximately 500 B.C. (see Brutsaert, 1982 for a chronological sketch), \nmost of the understanding of the governing factors has been achieved in the last two \ncenturies. Dalton (1802) was the first who proposed relationship of vapor pressure deficit \n(esat−eact) of the near surface air to the evaporation rate. Later, many empirical \nrelationships were developed based on other environmental factors (Blaney and Criddle, \n1950; Hargreaves, 1975; Thornthwaite, 1948). Based on available energy considerations \nand turbulent flux theory, Penman (1948) developed his evaporation equation for natural \nsurfaces for water non-limiting conditions. This is known as potential evapotranspiration \n(PET).  Monteith (1964) developed a modified version of the Penman equation in which \nbiophysics was introduced through a surface or canopy resistance – the now well-known \nPenman–Monteith (P-M) combination equation – that allowed for vegetation control on \ntranspiration rates.  \nChoudhury (1997) proposed a method to assess by means of satellite data, such as \nremotely sensed solar radiation, air temperature (derived from infrared images and \nweather station measurements) and vapor pressure deficit. This method provides good \nevapo-transpiration estimates for low-resolution applications such as worldwide scale and \nmonthly time step. The accuracy is limited by the high uncertainties provided by satellite-\nsensed vapor pressure estimation. \nLater, Bois et al. (2008) used remotely sensed solar radiation from METEOSAT \nobservations from Heliosat-2 approach (Rigollier et al. 2004) and air temperature data to \nestimate ETo using Hargreaves approach. The ETo can also be available as forecast bi-\nproduct from weather forecasting model. However, recent evaluation of predicted \nradiative fluxes and operational short-range forecasts (24 hrs average) of routine weather \nelements from model for a limited winter months showed that the incident shortwave \nradiative flux produced the highest root mean square error to the tune of 110% \n(Bhattacharya et al, 2012a) amongst others as compared to in situ measurements from \nINSAT-linked micrometeorological stations (popularly known as AMS). However, the \nerrors of short-range forecast of air temperatures, relative humidity, atmospheric  \npressure, wind speed at 10 m height were 3%, 12%, 21% and 1.4% respectively over \nplain and pleateu regions. The per cent RMSE for last four variables were found to \nincrease in the hilly terrain (Bhattacharya et al, 2012a). Expectedly, the ET0 would have \nsubstantial errors propagated mainly from incident solar radiation flux estimation. on the \nother hand, the operational product on daily insolation from Kalpana-1 VHRR produced \naround 25% RMSE (Bhattacharya et al, 2012b) with respect to same ground reference \nand the per cent RMSE decreased with averaging over weekly, ten-day, fortnightly and \nmonthly scales up to 15%. After improvement in the cloud flagging and the spatial \nresolution of operational insolation product from INSAT 3D, it is expected to produce \nsubstantially less errors. Therefore, it seems wise to use the combination of daily \ninsolation product from INSAT 3D and operational forecasts of air temperatures, relative \nPotential evapotranspiration \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n311\nhumidity, wind speed and atmospheric pressure to generate real-time digital and regional \nproduct of potential evapo-transpiration. \n19.2.2  Objectives \nThe objectives of this document are : \n(i) To outline the algorithm for the estimation of potential evapo-transpiration (ETo) \nbased on Penman-Monteith (P-M) approach (FAO-56 model) \n(ii) To integrate operational product of daily insolation from INSAT 3D and 24 hrs \naverage operational forecast of routine weather elements at finer spatial resolution \nto generate product of spatial ETo at 5 km spatial resolution \n(iii)To implement the algorithm in IMDPS GPR (Geophysical Parameter Retrieval) \nchain for automation of ETo product generation \n(iv) To describe validation strategy against in-situ measurements with initial results \n \n19.2.3    Instrument and characteristics of input products \n19.2.3.1 Indian geostationary satellite (INSAT 3D)  \nThe Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system is a joint venture of the Department of \nSpace (DOS), Department of Telecommunications (DOT), and India Meteorological \nDepartment (IMD). INSAT 3D is an exclusive meteorological satellite in the INSAT \nsystem, which was launched at geostationary orbit in 2013. This radiometer consists of \nfour bands : broad VIS (0.52-0.75), SWIR (1.55-1.70), MIR(3.8-4.0), WV(6.5-7.0) and \ntwo thermal TIR1(10.2-11.2), TIR2 (11.5-12.5) with nineteen sounder channel. The \nspatial resolution of VIS and SWIR band is 1 km x 1 km and 4 km x 4 km for MIR, \nWV and two thermal IR bands. The introduction of INSAT Meteorological Data \nProcessing System (IMDPS) provides both ‘full-globe’ and ‘sector’ data products in all \nthe bands at half-an-hour interval at 4 km spatial resolution in an automated mode. So, \nthere are maximum 48 acquisitions on a given day. Raw data after reception at each \nacquisition were corrected for servo, line-loss, radiometry, stagger and oversampling \nremoval using the INSAT 3D data products scheduler. This results into automated \ngeneration of co-registered data in each band at Transverse Mercator (TM) projection.  \nThe dimension of each band at each acquisition is 676 rows x 721 columns for Asia \nMercator sector product.  \n19.2.3.2  Operational insolation product \nA spectrally integrated clear-sky and three-layer cloudy-sky models were developed to \ndetermine integrated atmospheric transmittances and instantaneous insolation. Half-an-\nhourly observations from an Indian geostationary satellite sensor, INSAT 3D, were used \nto provide minimum ground brightness (surrogate of surface albedo) from previous 30 \ndays, cloud top albedo, brightness temperatures, atmospheric water vapour as inputs to \nthese models in addition to global eight-day aerosol optical depth at 550 nm and \ncolumnar ozone. A trapezoidal scheme was implemented to obtain daily insolation (in \nMJm-2) from half-an-hour instantaneous insolation (Wm-2) throughout the day for all-sky \nconditions (clear + cloudy). The whole algorithm (Bhattacharya et al, 2010 & 2012b) will \nbe operationalized  and daily insolation product can available at 4 km spatial resolution \nwith \nTransverse \nMercator \nprojection \nroutinely \nfrom \nMOSDAC \nsite \n(http://www.mosdac.gov.in).   \nPotential evapotranspiration \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n312\n19.2.3.3 Operational product of WRF short-range forecast \nWeather Research and Forecasting (WRF; Skamarock et al., 2008) Model version 3.1 is \nused for All India Short range weather forecast. WRF is a limited area, non-hydrostatic, \nprimitive equation model with multiple options for various physical parameterization \nschemes. This version employs Arakawa C-grid staggering for the horizontal grid and a \nfully compressible system of equations. The terrain following hydrostatic pressure co-\nordinate with vertical grid stretching is followed in vertical. The time-split integration \nuses 3rd order Runge-Kutta scheme with a smaller time step for acoustic and gravity wave \nmodes. The WRF physical options used in this proposal consists of the WRF Single \nMoment 6-class simple ice scheme for microphysics (WSM6); the Grell-Devenyi \nensemble cumulus convection parameterization scheme; and the Yonsei University \n(YSU) planetary boundary layer scheme.  \nThe WRF Model is integrated in a triple domain configuration with a horizontal \nresolution of 45 km, 15 km and 5 km for the All India, with grid points 260×235, \n352×373 and 676×721 in x and y directions for the domains 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The \nmodel has 36 vertical levels with the top of the model atmosphere located at 10 hPa. The \nWRF 3D-Var is used for the assimilation of all available conventional including ISRO-\nAWS data and satellite observations to improve the model initial conditions. The \noperational WRF short-range forecasts (Kumar et al., 2011), available at MOSDAC site \nused climatological land surface and atmospheric parameters from global database and \nassimilated all available conventional including ISRO-AWS and satellite observations \n(Kumar et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2011) from Indian and other International agencies (e.g. \nEUMETCast).  The operational forecast is available at finer spatial resolution (~ 5km) at \nthree hourly interval upto 72 hours. \nExamples of operational daily insolation product and 24 hrs average WRF forecast \nproduct of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and atmospheric pressure over \nIndian region are shown in Figure 1. \nPotential evapotranspiration \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n313\n19.3 Inputs \n19.3.1 Static data    :    NIL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1.

This \ncombination method was further extended to vegetated surface by introducing resistance \nterm. The aerodynamic and surface resistances have been added to the original equation \nof Penman to estimate Potential evapotranspiration (ETo) from a surface. This \nformulation is referred as FAO-56 Penman and Monteith (Allen et al., 1998) ETo for a \nday. This is treated as standardized model worldwide.

Example of monthly distribution of ET0 from VHRR insolation and WRF \nforecasts over Indian region \n \n19.7.1  Sensitivity of P-M model to weather variables for error budgeting \nThe sensitivity of P-M model ET0 was carried out by Bois et al (2008) using ‘Sobol’ \nmethod. It consists of numerous simulations of the models using two independent \nsamples of ‘N’ repetitions (rows) and ‘k’ input variables (columns), retrieved from \nexisting data or randomly generated data from the probability distribution function (PDF) \nof each ‘k’ input variable. One or several variables in the first sample are substituted by \nthe same variable (s) taken from the second sample. For each of the (2k - 1) possible \ncombinations of variable substitutions between the two samples, ‘N’ runs of the model \nare computed. The sensitivity of the model to input variables was based on so-called \nsensitivity or Sobol’ indices, which were calculated on the principle of the decomposition \nof the total variance (V) of the model output, in response to individual or simultaneous \nvariations of the ‘k’ model inputs. \nPotential evapotranspiration \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n321\nIn oceanic climate, the results of monthly sensitivity analyses computed using Southwest \narea (SW) data show clear seasonal trends (Figure 4). During the winter period (from \nNovember to February), wind speed is the main source of variation in ET0 values \ncalculated using P-M method (e.g. 38% of ET0 total variance in January). Then come \nrelative humidity and air temperature (32% and 17% of ET0 total variance in January, \nrespectively). Solar radiation, daily amplitude of air temperature and daily amplitude of \nrelative humidity have little impact on evapo-transpiration process during winter. This \ntrend changes during March and October. From April to September, ET0 is mostly \nsensitive to solar radiation (up to 74% of ET0 total variance in May, and 70% in July). \nFrom May to July, P-M formula is not very sensitive to relative humidity, air temperature \nand their diurnal amplitudes. Mean daily air temperature participate from 11% to 15% of \nET0 variance, from May to September. Total sensitivity indices show that, when added to \nother variables’ variations, air temperature has a greater impact on ET0 variability during \nsummer, and wind speed has a greater impact during winter (Figure 4B).  \nIn Mediterranean climate, sensitivity of ET0 computation to climate input variables using \nP-M method in Southeast area (SE) is very close to the one observed. Wind speed as a \nmajor impact on ET0 calculation during winter and solar radiation is clearly the most \ninfluent variable during summer (Figure 4C and D). The present analysis highlights the \ngreat sensitivity of this Penman–Monteith formula to solar radiation during summer \nperiod, when ET0 reaches its highest values, and when its calculation is critical for \nirrigation process and ecological modelling. These results were obtained for \nMediterranean and Oceanic climate, at medium latitudes. A recent work published by \nGong et al. (2006) on a large range of climatic conditions in Southern China leads to \nsimilar results, except for relative humidity which had a greater impact on ET0 during \nwinter than it has been shown in the present study. Considering the results of Penman–\nMonteith sensitivity to solar radiation, it seems reasonable to evaluate the benefits of \nsatellite-sensed solar radiation to ET0 calculation.  \nPotential evapotranspiration \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n322\n \nFigure 4. Plots of sensitivity indices (A–C) Southwest area (SW). and (D–F) Southeast \narea (SE) of ET0 to different climatic variables \n \n19.7.1.1   Preliminary comparison with in-situ measurements \nThe daily insolation product (Bhattacharya et al., 2012b) from K1VHRR available \nthrough MOSDAC (Meteorological and Oceanic Satellite Data Archival Centre) for the \nperiod January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011 to derive radiation parameters and other \nroutine inputs from WRF forecast were ingested into P-M model to generate daily, \ndekadal (ten-day) and monthly ET0 estimates at regional scale following the steps \nmentioned in section 4.12. To validate satellite based regional ETo estimates, the \nmeasurements from INSAT-linked AMS (Agro-Met-Station) data were used \n(Bhattacharya et al, 2009). The AMS provides all radiation and meteorological variables \nat 30 minutes interval and represent a fetch area of 1 km x 1 km. The AMS data from six \nsites over different agro-climatic zones were used to compute ETo on daily basis for \ndifferent time period as listed in Table 6. The ETo was calculated on daily basis using \nAMS half-an-hour average measurements.  \n \nPotential evapotranspiration \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n323\nTable  6.

Daily scale \nDaily ETo estimated using P-M approach was compared with daily ETo computed from \nAMS measurements for different agro-climatic regions as listed in Table 6. The 1:1 plot \nis shown in Figure 5 and temporal comparison is shown in Figure 6. The daily ETo \ncomputed from AMS varied from 0.7 mm to 12.0 mm while satellite derived ETo varied \nfrom 1.1 to 11.7 mm over different seasons for selected stations. The error analysis \nshowed the root mean square deviation (RMSD) varied from 1.13 to 3.82 mmd-1 to the \ntune of 21 to 38 % of measured mean over six stations (Table 7). The overall pooled data \nset showed RMSD of 1.34 mmd-1 with 29% deviation from measured mean. This was due \nto high fluctuation of ETo on daily temporal scale as shown in Figure 5 for all six AMS \nstations. The estimated daily ETo showed underestimation as well as overestimation for \nall AMS stations but extent of temporal pattern matches quite well in all the stations. \n \n  \nPotential evapotranspiration \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n324\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5. 1:1 scatter plot between daily ETo from AMS and estimates from satellite and \nWRF  \n \nPotential evapotranspiration \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n325\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6.

The 10-days cumulative \nestimated ETo was validated with cumulative ETo from AMS data. The temporal 10-day \nETo over different stations are shown in Figure 7 for six selected stations and error \nstatistics are given in Table 8. The dekadal change in estimated ETo matched well with \nAMS ETo. The seasonal change was also well captured in 10-day cumulative ETo.  \nIn Naraingarh, Punjab, the comparison was made for the period from January to April. In \nJanuary and February, ETo remained low in the range of 16 mm to 24 mm due to low \nradiation and temperature. It started rising in March and reached up to 62 mm per dekad. \nThe rise and fall of computed ETo was well captured in estimated ETo during January to \nApril. The RMSD was 9.3 mm which is 28.9% of AMS mean for the stated period. The \n1:1 scatter (Figure 8) showed a 91 % correlation.  \n \nTable  8.

During this period rabi rice is grown with available irrigation facility. The dekadal \ntemporal profile of estimated ETo matched well with AMS ETo but showed small amount \nof deviation during April. This may be due to application of irrigation water in rice crop \nand was only captured in computed ETo from AMS but not reflected in estimated ETo. \nThe temporal variation of dekadal ETo was 28 to 30 mm in January with gradual rise in \nFebruary. The maximum ETo was observed in April due to rise in temperature and \nPotential evapotranspiration \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n327\nradiation load. This seasonal change of ETo was well captured in the estimates.  The \noverall RMSD was found to be 10.5 mm (27.4 % of AMS mean) on January to April with \nrespect to AMS.   \nThe central plateau and hill agro-climatic region is represented here by AMS at \nPowarkheda site. The area falls under the catchment of Narmada where annual rainfall \nvaries from 800 to 1200 mm. The wheat crop is dominant during rabi season. The \nestimated dekadal ETo estimates matched well throughout January to May. The dekadal \nhigh and low value matched quite well and estimated ETo always remained high as \ncompared to AMS ETo up to March during growth of wheat crop. After that, estimated \nETo underestimated measured ETo.  In January, both showed low values in the range of \n30 to 37 mm and 35 to 46 mm but goes up to 97 to 103 mm (AMS) and 82 to 94 mm \n(estimated) in May. The temporal profiles matched quite well and showed RMSD of 10.4 \nmm over ten days (16.6% deviation from AMS mean). \nThe typical Indian arid region lies in western, dry agro-climatic region and represented \nhere by Jaisalmer. The climate remains hot throughout the year except in January and \nFebruary. The data over  monsoon season (July, August and September) were used for \ncomputation of ETo. In this part of India, S-W monsoon starts in July and it was well \ncaptured by dekadal ETo variation during stated months. During July, ETo remained \nhigher but later in the season it reduced in both the cases. The satellite estimated ETo \nshowed both underestimation and overestimation for selected season as compared to \nAMS. The temporal profile of ETo of two followed the same pattern. The RMSD of 6.3 \nmm was found for monsoon season which is 10.2% with respect to AMS ETo.  \nThe southern part of India, AMS located in LPSC Mahandragiri represents the natural \nscrub vegetation. The AMS data for January to May and August to November were used \nfor comparison with AMS ETo value. The temporal profile of dekadal ETo matched well \nwith AMS ETo. The difference between two was maximum during north-east monsoon \nseason (January to February) but later on, the difference was reduced further in May and \nNovember. The data showed a RMSD of 9.4 mm (21.4% deviation of measured AMS \nmean).  \nThe island agroclimatic region of Andaman & Nicobar have different climatic conditions \nas compared to above stated regions. As this region is surrounded by Bay of Bengal so \nclimatic condition remains humid throughout the year. The data from March to May and \nAugust to November were used for comparison. The AMS ETo on an average had a range \nof 23 to 50 mm throughout the selected time domain. Similar order of magnitude was \nobserved for estimated ETo. The dekadal behaviour of estimated ETo matched well with \nAMS ETo but showed little higher deviation during August and September. It showed \nRMSD of 9.3 mm (25.0% of AMS mean).      \n \nPotential evapotranspiration \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n328\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 7.

The correlation coefficient between estimated and measured \nETo gradually increased from daily to 10-day but maximum increase was observed from \ndaily to 7-day i.e from 8% to 23% for six AMS stations. The rise of correlation \ncoefficient from 7-day to 10 days was nominal in Nariangarh (PAU) (0.7%), Chakdah \n(BCKV) (2%), Pawarkheda (2.3%) and Jaisalmer (6.3%) as compared to LPSC \n(Mahandergiri) (13.8%) and Diglipur (12.6%) as shown in Figure 8. Similarly per cent \ndeviation from mean of AMS measurements also showed a similar trend as the deviation \ndrastically came down from daily to 7-days and further nominal decrease in 10-day \nexcept than in Jaisalmer. For the latter, it decreases from 14.8% to 10.2% for 7 to 10-days \nas marked in Figure 9. The analysis showed that error was significantly reduced from \ndaily to 7-days and further in 10-days over different agro-climatic zones. This will help \nus use this ETo data in various applications on different time scales with known errors.      \n  \n \n \n \nFigure 9. Error analysis of ETo for variable-time accumulation \n \n19.7.1.4 Comparison of errors from similar studies elsewhere \nConsidering the results of Penman–Monteith sensitivity to solar radiation, it seems \nreasonable to evaluate the benefits of satellite-sensed solar radiation to estimate spatial \nETo as no regular spatial record are available for solar radiation. Choudhury (1997) \nattempted monthly global ETo at 0.25o x 0.25o from P-M method using solar radiation \nfrom International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP). He derived vapour \npressure and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) from TIROS operational vertical sounder \nTOVS data with air temperature based on interactive GCM forecast retrieval assimilation \nsystem applied to the TOVS data. He has compared the estimated ETo with lysimeter data \nand on monthly scale the error was found between 15 to 40% from measured mean.  \nBois et al. (2008) used remotely sensed solar radiation and weather data from AWS \nequipped with humidity, thermal sensors and cup anemometer to estimate ETo using \nPotential evapotranspiration \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n331\nFAO-56 P-M  method. They used the solar radiation prepared from Meteosat data by \nfollowing Heliosat-2 method (Rigollier et al. 2004). The study found that most of the \nerrors occurred in partial cloudy days due to uncertainties in retrieving daily solar \nradiation. On daily scale, the RMSD was between 0.34 to 1.32 mm (11% to 110% from \ndaily mean) but on annual scale the RMSD remained low (11% of ETo mean value) at \n0.05o X 0.05o spatial resolution. This error again came down to (9.1% to 5% of ETo mean \nvalue) during clear days in summer.  Our study was unique as we used operational \nproduct of K1VHRR insolation WRF 3-hourly forecast for at 0.05°grid for estimation of \nETo at 0.08o X 0.08o. On daily scale, RMSD  was 1.1 to 3.8 mm (21% to 38% from \nmeasured mean) but it came down to 10% to 28% from mean on dekadal time scale and \nfurther in monthly scale (21% from monthly mean). The overall error at different \ntemporal domain were found in good harmony with reported errors in other part of world.   \n19.8 \nSources of errors / uncertainties in ETo estimates and validation issues  \nThe following sources of uncertainties were traced out while evaluating spatial output of \nETo estimates and its comparison with ground reference \n(i) Influence of vegetation in AMS \nThe FAO 56 P-M method is generally applied for a specific site using meteorological and \nradiation data from meteorological observatories or AWS weather data including direct \nmeasurement of radiation. In India, ISRO-AWS does not provide solar radiation data in \nterms of standard energy units. IMD AWS provide data with some lag period. The \nsensitivity analysis of P-M method by Gong et al. (2006) and Bois et al. (2008) \nhighlighted that solar radiation and wind speed were clearly the most influent variables \nfor ETo estimation. The pyranometer and routine weather data from AMS are used. But \nthese measurements were recorded over different vegetation cover types. Since \nvegetation growth influences ambient weather conditions, the ETo computed from AMS \nwould definitely have differential vegetation influence when compared to ETo estimates \nfrom integration of satellite based solar radiation and WRF forecast weather variables.  \n(ii) Scale mismatch \nSpatial ETo was generated at approximately 8 km spatial resolution with 64 km2 pixel \narea      while the average footprint of AMS varies from 0.25 to 1 km2. This scale \nmismatch puts constrain in validation statistics. But this scale mismatch will reduced with \nINSAT 3D.  \n(iii) Difference in time sampling \nFor spatial ETo, daily solar radiation was generated from diurnal observations at \ninstantaneous snapshots with half-an-hour interval from satellite platform. But half-an-\nhourly averages from AMS measurements were used to generate validation datasets \n(iv) Accuracy in cloud flagging  \nThe product version of surface insolation algorithm has cloud detection capability of \napproximately 80%. It could not detect thinner clouds. Therefore, ETo estimates have \nhigher errors during the period more cloudy spells or for AMS sites with higher cloud \ndynamics such as Diglipur (A & N), LPSC, Mahendragiri etc. \nPotential evapotranspiration \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n332\n(v) Quality of WRF forecast \nAn initial evaluation of WRF forecast quality showed an average error to the tune of 1-\n2°C, RH of 5-10% as compared to large error in wind speed and predicted radiation terms. \nThe inherent errors in first three variables will have implications on the overall error \nbudget. \n19.9 \nFuture scope of improvement  \nRecent improvement has taken place in the cloud detection of INSAT  3D insolation \nalgorithm using additional criteria based on cloudiness index from VIS band observations. \nMuch of the uncertainties in insolation and ETo estimates in cloudy-skies will hopefully \nbe improved. \nRecent study on impact of updated vegetation fraction from INSAT 3A CCD showed \nimprovement in air temperature, humidity and rainfall forecast from WRF. The use of \nreal-time satellite based other land surface products such as albedo, LAI and soil moisture \nwould definitely help in improving the quality of operational forecasts. Future work \nshould address the retrieval / estimation of those variables from Indian geostationary \nsatellites.  \nThe INSAT 3D will provide relatively finer spatial resolution of observation of insolation. \nThis would reduce the scale mismatch uncertainty for validation. \n19.10 References \n1.

It is composed of direct and \ndiffuse components. While reaching the ground from top-of-atmosphere solar radiation  \nis attenuated by different atmospheric constituents such as water vapour, ozone, aerosol, \nair molecule, clouds and fogs through scattering and absorption processes. The molecular \nscattering by air molecules is known as Rayleigh scattering. The aerosol scattering is Mie \nscattering. The component of solar radiation that reaches earth surface without deviation \nfrom original direction is known as direct or beam insolation. The component of solar \nradiation reaching earth surface after scattering is known as diffuse insolation. Diffuse \ncomponent is composed of three components such as : Rayleigh scattered, aerosol \nscattered and reflected multiple scattered insolation. Clouds play major role in attenuating \nsolar radiation while reaching earth surface. It is accountable for 70% depletion of solar \nradiation depending on its type, distribution and ice-cloud proportioning of three-\ndimensional vertical structure. Moreover, aerosol acts as cloud condensation nucleii \n(CCN). The contribution of clouds towards diurnal variability of insolation is more than \naerosol and atmospheric gases specially during monsoon season. Fog also plays an \nimportant role in attenuating solar radiation in the winter. The interaction of solar \nradiation with atmospheric constituents and clouds is shown in Figure 1. \nSurface insolation over land \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n338\n \nFigure 1: Interaction of incident solar radiation (irradiance) with major atmospheric \nagents for its depletion in clear and cloudy skies \n \nSurface insolation is the driving input for eco-physiological processes such as \nevapotranspiration (Jacobs et al, 2000) and photosynthesis (Chen et al, 1999). The \ntrapped energy through formation of ATP and NADPH in ‘light reaction’ is utilized in \nthe ‘dark reaction’ of photosynthesis to produce carbohydrates. The photosynthetic \nresponse of plant species to different light intensity determines primary productivity, \ntherefore, it is as critical component to assess bio-energy and bio-fuel resources. \nInsolation is the major contributor of earth’s radiation and energy budget. It is also a \ncrucial input to crop simulation model for yield forecasting.  \nIn climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, use of renewable energy resources \nsuch as solar energy plays important role to maintain a emission-free green and safe \nenvironment. Monthly solar radiation maps on spatial scale are very important to locate \nsolar energy conversion systems such as solar PV or thermal power plants (Janjai et al, \n2005). Conventionally, these maps are constructed from high density network of \npyranometers. However, in India, a very sparse network of pyranometer stations is \npresently operating. Interpolation from such sparse network produces large errors (60-\n70%) due to large uncertainties of intermittent diurnal cloud cover, cloud types and \natmospheric turbidity in cloudless skies. Moreover, high maintenance costs and lack of \navailability of real-time data are major impediments. Several estimation models have \nbeen developed based on temperature amplitude, sunshine hours or cloud cover and \nSurface insolation over land \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n339\ncombination of temperature, humidity, rainfall, but these require site and season specific \ncalibration coefficients and thus difficult to extrapolate. Moreover, such models do not \nexplicitly consider the role of atmospheric constituents such as air molecule, aerosol, \nwater vapour, ozone. The use of remote sensing observations from geostationary satellite \nsensors that have high temporal sampling frequency (multiple passes every day) are ideal \nto capture spatio-temporal variability of surface insolation for those regions where \nregular measurements from sparse radiation network and their availability are not \nconsistent till date.  \n20.2.1 Overview and background \nBroadly, two approaches such as (a) statistical or empirical (Tarpley, 1979; Noia et al, \n1993) and (b) physical or radiative transfer (Tanahashi et al, 2001) schemes are in use to \nestimate surface insolation using geostationary satellite data using broad visible band and \nthermal infrared bands. Empirical or statistical techniques for surface insolation include \nHeliosat (Dagestad, 2004), contrast ratio (Rosema et al, 2004) approaches applied to \nMeteosat. Heliosat model has been developed under Helioclim project of Europe and has \nundergone several revisions. It is based on deriving cloudiness index from maximum, \nminimum albedo in a time series and current albedo. This cloudiness index is converted \ninto surface insolation through clearness index (ratio of surface insolation and insolation \nat-top-atmosphere) using pre-determined empirical relations. Physical modelling schemes \nof clear sky insolation are of two types: (i) ‘top-down’ approach that corrects incoming \nsolar irradiance (Pinker and Lazlo, 1992; Lu et al, 2010) for atmospheric attenuation \n(absorption and scattering) before reaching the surface (ii) ‘bottom-up’ approach that \ndetermines surface albedo (Gautier et al, 1980) from planetary albedo by separating out \natmospheric interferences and arrive at surface insolation through inversion. Several \nschemes are available to account for attenuation of solar radiation flux passing through \nclouds either using cloud top albedo or reflectivity that represents cloud backscatters or \nfrom combination of cloud-top albedo or temperature or cloud optical thickness and \ncloud-top pressure. Spectrally integrated irradiance model and three-layer cloudy scheme \nwere implemented with Kalpana-1 VIS, WV and thermal IR bands to estimate \ninstantaneous and daily insolation (Bhattacharya et al, 2012 and 2013). Statistical models \nare only based on visible band observations while physical model requires inputs from \nboth visible and thermal bands in addition to determination of cloud mask. While the \nerrors of statistical techniques varied from 12–17% for daily total insolation (Kandirmaz \net al, 2004), the physical approach produces error of about ± 19% on hourly basis and \nlesser for daily to monthly averaging. Moreover, the statistical models call for region-\nspecific updates of coefficients through ground datasets which are time consuming. \n20.2.2  Objectives \nThe objectives of this document are : \n(i)      To outline a physical algorithm for surface insolation estimation  \n(ii)      To highlight the sensitivity of algorithm and evaluation of estimates from \nthis algorithm applied with Kalpana-1 VHRR data  \n(iii)     To describe the path of integrating algorithm with Indian geostationary \nsatellite (e.g. INSAT 3D) based on cloud properties, aerosol, water vapour \nand ozone products \nSurface insolation over land \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n340\n(iv)     To implement the algorithm in a software compatible to IMDPS geophysical \nparameter retrieval chain for automated generation of instantaneous and \ndaily insolation \n(v)      To describe validation strategy of operational product of INSAT 3D \ninsolation against in-situ measurements, reanalysis data, other satellite \nproducts \n(vi)     To outline the scope of improvement in the accuracy of the estimates in \nfuture  \n20.2.3 Instrument characteristics \nThe Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system is a joint venture of the Department of \nSpace (DOS) and India Meteorological Department (IMD). It provides half-an-hour \nobservations from six channel ‘Imager’ and 19-channel ‘Sounder’. The Imager has one \nbroad VIS (0.55-0.75 m) band (1 km x 1 km), one SWIR (1.55 – 1.70 m) band (1km \nx 1km), one MIR (3.8 – 4.0 m) band (4 km x 4 km), one water vapour (6.5 - 7.1m) \nband (8 km x 8 km) and two split thermal (10.2 - 11.3 m, 11.5 - 12.5 m) bands (4 km \nx 4 km). The sounder has 19 channels to provide vertical profiles of atmospheric \ntemperature and humidity. There are 22 geophysical products which are scheduled to \nbe available from an operational processing known as INSAT Meteorological Data \nProcessing System (IMDPS). This has been successfully implemented in Kalpana-1 \nVHRR and INSAT 3A VHRR and CCD (Anonymous, 2005). This system provides \nboth ‘full-globe’ and ‘sector’ data products. Presently, there are 40 acquisitions against \na  maximum of 48 acquisitions per day. Raw data after reception at each acquisition are  \ncorrected for servo, lineloss, radiometry, stagger and oversampling removal using data \nproducts scheduler. These result into automated generation of co-registered data with \nfixed projection having fixed number of rows and columns.

The aerosol optical depth at 550 nm from MODIS product was converted to \nSurface insolation over land \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n345\nAngstrom ‘β’ turbidity parameter to compute aerosol transmittance assuming Angstrom \nturbidity exponent parameter as 1.3 ( Iqbal 1983 ). The ozone data from MODIS was \nused to compute ozone transmittance. \nThe monthly minimum ground brightness from previous thirty days VIS band planetary \nalbedo \n was dynamically determined for each acquisition and was used as \nsurrogate for ground albedo \n The planetary VIS band spectral albedo was corrected \nfor Rayleigh scattering. The aerosol scattering effect and cloud interferences on planetary \nalbedo were assumed to be removed with monthly minimum composites understanding \nthat surface properties have not changed significantly within thirty days. The multiple \nscattering component contributes little to total diffuse irradiance over vegetated region \n(albedo between 0.1 and 0.3) but is a dominant component over snow bound areas or \ndesert ( > 0.3) with significantly higher albedo.  \n20.4.1.3 \nGlobal or total irradiance \nBoth direct and diffuse irradiance are dependent on the zenith angle of the sun that \nchanges from sunrise to sunset and on the orientation of the surface. On an arbitrarily \ninclined surface with slope,  , and aspect,  , at a given location on earth surface with \nlatitude, , the angle \n between the incident radiation and the normal to the surface is \nexpressed as , \n \n                                (12)                             \n              \n \n \n \n \n  (13) \n = solar declination angle (radian) \nh = sun hour angle (radian) \nDepending on the terrain properties and solar geometry, the surface may be in the shadow \nof nearby topographic features; \nis then assigned a value of zero that represents no \ndirect irradiances. Diffuse radiation was assumed to be isotropic in distribution in the \natmosphere, i.e. the sky is uniformly bright. Depending on the slope and nearby \ntopography, only a fraction of hemisphere might be visible, which is referred as the sky-\nview factor \n, which is time invariant and is dependent only on terrain parameters. \nThe total \nor global irradiances (Wm-2) received on surface at any instance \n is \ngiven by, \n                        (14) \nThe \n is determined as the ratio of diffuse sky irradiance to that on an unobstructed \nsurface.

Cloudy-sky model \nA three-layer scheme was conceptualized and implemented to compute irradiances in \ncloudy skies. The first layer corresponds to clear-sky atmosphere over cloud-top where \ndirect and diffuse components were computed using algorithm mentioned in section 3.1. \nMolecular (above cloud) and aerosol scattering, gaseous transmission due to ozone were \nconsidered. Entire aerosol and ozone were assumed to be distributed above cloud. Both \ndirect and diffuse components were computed and the sum of these two resulted into \nglobal irradiances without any sky-view factor. The second layer corresponds to plane \nparallel cloud. The vertical cloud structure and its three-dimensional effects on cloud \ntransmission especially on diffuse component were not considered in the present model. \nThe third layer corresponds to clear-sky atmosphere below cloud. Molecular scattering \n(air below cloud) was only considered in layer 3. The precipitable water was assumed \nentirely distributed below cloud and contributed to gaseous transmission along with other \ngases.  \nIn order to compute Rayleigh scattering above cloud, the height of cloud-top was \napproximated from cloud-top temperature, maximum clear-sky planetary temperature \nwithin previous 30 days, ground elevation and dry-adiabatic lapse rate up to condensation \nlevel represented through cloud-top temperature. Here also, direct, diffuse and global \nirradiances were computed using the principles used in the section 3.1. The irradiance \ncoming out of first and top clear-sky layer after attenuation is considered as the incoming \nsolar radiation flux cloud layer. The energy flux that comes out after being attenuated in \ncloud layer was considered as influx for third layer (clear-sky layer below cloud) which \nagain gets attenuated to reach at the ground. The global irradiance received at the ground \nis considered as insolation in cloudy-sky. \nThe transmission through cloud was computed using Kubelka-Munk theory. \n                                  \n \n \n \n \n              (16) \n This relates cloud-top albedo \n with cloud transmittance (\n. The coefficients \n in the equation 16 vary according to different land use categories which were \ntaken into account through typical ranges (< 0.2 for water bodies, forest; 0.21 to 0.32 for \nagriculture; >0.3 for desert and snow cover) of ground albedo represented by minimum \nground brightness from previous thirty days. \n20.4.3  Daily integration \nA trapezoidal integration was applied to construct daily integral from diurnal \ninstantaneous global irradiances. The daily integral global irradiance \n was expressed in \nMJm-2. The mathematical expression for daily integration is: \n \n \n \n(17) \n Here  represents hours in GMT.  \nSurface insolation over land \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n347\n20.4.4 Flow chart \nFigure 3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n20.4.5   Operational implementation \nStep 1:  Unpacking and pre-processing \nFirst sub-program should unpack h5 (Hierarchical data format) datasets from INSAT 3D \nImager, reads DEM and computes date, time, year from name of file string as well as \nsun-sensor zenith, azimuth angles. Brightness temperatures in IR and WV bands and VIS \nalbedo (after removing perturbation due to molecular scattering) were also computed \nfrom look-up table (LUT) and calibration coefficients provided with h5 datasets. \nStep 2 : Generation of minimum ground brightness and maximum brightness \ntemperatures for cloud-fog detection and cloud height determination \nThis sub-program uses INSAT 3D ‘Imager’ brightness temperatures and VIS band  \nalbedo or reflectance of a lead of previous 30 days. The maximum temperatures and \nminimum albedo were picked up for each pixel at a given acquisition.  Both are used as \nbi-spectral thresholds to detect cloud. In addition, a cloudiness index is generated through \nnormalization of VIS band TOA reflectance, its upper and lower limts. Both dynamic \nbispectral thresholds and threshold of cloudiness index ( > 0.15) are used to for cloud and \nfog detection and masking during daylight hours. Temperature composites and current \nacquisition temperature will be used to determine cloud height from dry-adiabatic-lapse-\nrate (DALR) \nStep 4 : Interpolation of climatic gridded AOD550, ozone and resampling \nAnother sub-program should use eight-day gridded (1° x 1°) climatological aerosol \noptical depth (AOD) and ozone to extract from global products for the latitude and \nSurface insolation over land \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n348\nlongitude bounds of south-east Asia corresponding to K1VHRR Asia Mercator sector \ncoverages. These can be resampled down to 8 km spatial resolution using bilinear \ninterpolation and reprojected to INSAT 3D Imager projection.  \nStep 4 :  Generation of time series instantaneous insolation \nThe main program should compute time series instantaneous global (direct + diffuse) \ninsolation for a given acquisition using the outputs from other sub-programs, clear-sky \nand cloudy-sky models. \nStep 5 : Daily integration  \nAnother program should perform trapezoidal integration of both bias-uncorrected and \nbias-corrected instantaneous insolation at 23:30 hrs GMT on a given day. This program \nshould fetch instantaneous insolation from different acquisitions on a given day and make \na list. This program should first check at least one acquisition within two hours and then \ndaily integration should be performed. It means that If at least well distributed five \ninstantaneous insolation are available in the list, the integration is performed. \nThe whole algorithm has been implemented with Kalpana-1 VHRR data from 2012 to \ngenerate operational products on insolation after the clearance by ATBD review \ncommittee set-up by Director, SAC and in-house T & E has also been carried out. \nThe same algorithm was applied with INSAT 3D ‘Imager’ data to estimate instantaneous \ninsolation over limited datasets \n20.5 Outputs \nTable 5 \nParameter \nUnit \nMin \nMax \nAccuracy \nResolution \nA.

Diffuse insolation, in general, showed gradual increase with increase in \nAOD500 but it reached plateau at higher solar zenith angle with AOD500 beyond 0.2. \nSurface insolation over land \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n352\nDiffuse fraction was found to show sharp increase between 0.12 to 0.28 and 0.18 to 0.38 \nat low (17.46) and high (41.1) solar zenith angles with increase in AOD500 between 0.1 \nto 0.6. But the higher diffuse fraction was noticed at higher solar zenith angles for similar  \nAOD500. It was found that there was practically little decrease (3-7%) in global, direct \nand diffuse insolation with increase in water vapour between 1.5 to 6.5 cm (Figure 5b). \nThe decrease was still less for ozone (Figure 5c) varying between 240 to 290 dobson \nunits.  \n \n \nFigure 5b.

The selection criteria for choosing quality \nvalidation datasets are described below : \na) Days with daily insolation estimates constituted from at least one instantaneous \ninsolation per hour between 00 GMT to 1300 GMT will only be used for \nvalidation. These maintain diurnal symmetry to produce reliable daily integral \nb)  The days with in situ continuous half-an-hourly measurements are retained for \nvalidation.

The transmitted data through \nINSAT 3A were received at Bopal Earth Station (BES). The in situ data at half-an-hour \ninterval for Hyatnagar (17.82ºN, 78.98ºE), Andhra Pradesh, Chakdah (23.06ºN, 88.54ºE), \nWest Bengal, Sriharikota (13.62ºN, 80.22ºE), Andhra Pradesh, Hoshangabad (22.70ºN, \n77.75ºE ), Madhya Pradesh, Khazwal (23.53ºN, 93.18ºE), Mizoram, Chilika (19.71ºN, \n85.19ºE), Orissa were used to validate the INSAT 3D based estimates. The data coverage \nwas good for AMS at Hyatnagar and Hoshangabad. The AMS data coverge was less in \nrest of the locations. Altogether 90 (ninety) datasets could be obtained from AMS for \nvalidation for the period 1 to 15 October 2013. \n \n \n \n \nSurface insolation over land \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n355\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 10. Validation of INSAT 3D instantaneous insolation with limited measurements  \n                  from AMS \n \nThe operational product (K1-VHR-INS) of instantaneous insolation estimates at 8 km \nspatial resolution from Kalpana-1 VHRR were obtained for 0330, 0500, 0530, 0600, \n0630, 0700, 0730, 0800, 0830, 1130 for 1 to 15 October 2013 were obtained through \nMOSDAC (http://www.mosdac.gov.in). The mean insolation from diurnal instances of \nKalpana-1 VHRR was compared with mean insolation from ‘Imager’. \nA comparison was made between insolation estimates averaged over 3 x 3 pixels (~ 12 \nkm x 12 km) and in situ point measurements from Agro-Met Station (AMS) at coincident \ntimings during 1 to 15 October 2013. There was significant correlation (r = 0.72) between \nthese two from 90 paired datasets (Figure 6). This showed a mean bias of 37 Wm-2 and \nRMSE of the order of 16.8% of measured mean from AMS. The RMSE has been reduced \nsubstantially as compared to reported RMSE (25%) of instantaneous insolation from \nKalpana-1 VHRR estimates averaged over 64 km x 64 km and with respect to AMS-\nbased point measurements.  The scatter of points around 1:1 line could be due to \ndifferences in scale mismatch between estimates and measurements leading to loss of \nsub-pixel cloud heterogeneity. \nA qualitative comparison (Figure 7) was made between ‘Imager’ and VHRR insolation \nfor 0730 GMT on 13 October 2013 to look into the impact of better resolution (0.04 deg) \nof ‘Imager’ on insolation specially in cloudy patches. \nSurface insolation over land \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n356\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Figure 7.

Majority of \nthe difference was in the range of 10 – 30 Wm-2.  \n20.7.3.3 Sources of uncertainties  \nThe possible sources of uncertainties that contribute to errors in K1VHRR daily \ninsolation estimates are outlined below : \nInput levels \n(i) Inherent accuracies of products of aerosol, atmospheric water vapour \n(ii) Inaccuracy of cloud and fog mask \n(iii) Uncertainty of periodic updation of calibration coefficient of VIS band \nModel structure \n(iv) Cloud-top reflectivity is considered, no cloud absorption is considered for cloud \nattenuation \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 8.

The use of estimates averaged \nover 3 X 3 pixels for validation with measurements at tower foot-print scale may be \nvalid for cloudless skies. But it may lead to underestimation if cloud patches are \npresent and irregularly distributed in the surrounding pixels but not in the central \npixel. It may lead to overestimation if cloudy patches are only present in the central \npixel representing tower location but not in the surrounding pixels.  \n \n(viii) Difference in temporal sampling \nThe ISRO-AMS observations on incident shortwave radiation were sampled at 5 \nminutes interval and averaged over half-an-hour. Imager will sample with \ninstantaneous snapshots at 30 minutes interval. Therefore, it misses out intermittent \ncloud presence and its spatio-temporal dynamics. These differences must have \nintroduced some uncertainties in the validation results. \nSensitivity analysis showed little influence of ozone and water vapour content on \ninsolation at different solar zenith angles. But strong sensitivity of AOD at 550 nm was \nobserved on insolation. Single scattering albedo (\n was assumed 1.0 in the present \nmodel. In reality, it varied between 0.7603 to 0.9921 among urban-rural-ocean aerosol \ntypes (Li 1998).  \n20.8 Limitations of algorithm and issues in operational scenario \nPresent algorithm has the following limitations : \n The present algorithm does not consider scattering of incoming solar radiation \nwith raindrops. Therefore, it will lead to inaccuracies in cloudy-sky conditions \nwith rain occurrence. \n Cloud has different proportions of liquid water and ice. Attenuation by them \nindividually is not considered.  \n Under cloudy-sky conditions a constant precipitable water of 5.5 gcm-2 was \nassumed which may not be always true. \n All aerosols were assumed to be distributed above cloud. Perturbations by \naerosols below cloud were not considered. \n Ground brightness and cloud top albedo are represented by minimum VIS TOA \nalbedo of previous 30 days. Instead, minimum shortwave albedo needs to be used. \n Apart from the above, the sources of uncertainties enumerated in the validation \nsection (section 1.6.3.1) are the sources of inaccuracies. \nSurface insolation over land \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n359\n20.9 Future scope of improvement \n Megha-Trophique (MT) ScaRaB data can be utilized to know the relation \nbetween VIS spectral albedo and shortwave albedo radiance, fluxes which will \nhelp in computing shortwave albedo including surface and cloud-top. The relation \ncan be extended to INSAT VIS band data to know the minimum ground \nbrightness. \n Revised cloud transmission should be introduced separately for different cloud \ntypes of low, medium and high level for different background land types. \n The near-real time diurnal aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550nm from INSAT 3D \n‘Imager’ would help minimize the uncertainities introduced by aerosol \nclimatology. The network of diurnal measurements of aerosol optical depth and \nits other properties from 10 IMD land stations or AERONET over India can be \nexplored to offset bias in AOD estimates. The real-time availability of these data \nwould help remove the residual bias.  \n Bias correction model would be developed from validation results from one year \ndatasets and will be applied later to improve the accuracy.  \n Quality flag should be tagged with insolation product. \n20.10 References \n1.

Generally high pressure areas have relatively higher geopotential heights than \nlow pressure areas. It is also a fundamental quantity that is used in atmospheric general \ncirculation models. At mid-latitudes they also indicate the underlying large-scale waves \nsuch as Rossby waves. By looking at the geopotential heights one can infer the first guess \natmospheric wind pattern (also known as geostrophic approximation) especially for mid-\nlatitudes. \n \n1.2.2 Objective \nTo derive geopotential heights at 40 pressure levels from 1000 hPa to 0.1 hPa. \n \n1.3 Inputs \n1.3.1 Static Data \nTopographic data at sounder horizontal resolution. \n \n1.3.2   Dynamic Data \nRetrieved temperature and humidity profiles at 40 pressure levels \n \n \nApplication parameters from sounder derived products \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n367\n \n1.3.3  Other auxiliary and Model Inputs \n1000 hPa analysed heights from IMD or ECMWF/NCEP or surface pressure and surface \ntemperature. \n \n1.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications \n1.4.1 Theoretical Background \nGiven pressure, temperature and humidity profile from surface to 0.1 hPa, height of any \npressure level or thickness of atmospheric layer from surface to a particular pressure level \ncan be  computed using the formula \n \n)\nln( P\nP\ng\nT\nR\nZ\ns\nv\nd\n\n \n \nPs – Surface Pressure, P – Given pressure where geopotential height is to be calculated, \nvT  - Layer mean virtual temperature.

By using H instead of Z, one \ncan use g = 9.8 ms-2, a constant value in calculations. In reality, g decreases slightly with \naltitude. Difference between Z and H can be as much as 16m at the height of 10 km \nabove sea level depending on pressure, temperature and humidity profile. Error in Z \ndepends on error in retrieved temperature, specific humidity profiles as well as the \nsurface pressure from analysis. Assuming pressure estimates are error free, a 0.5 K error \nin estimation of layer mean virtual temperature results in about 10 meter error in Z. Thus \nthe error in Z is very much dependent on the uncertainties in the retrieved temperature \nand specific humidity profiles (Roland Stull, 2000). \n \n1.4.2 Operational Implementation \nOnce temperature and humidity profiles are available from surface and all 40 standard \npressure levels, Z can be estimated from the formula described in the previous section. \nLayer mean virtual temperature (between pressure levels p1 and p2) may be estimated by \nusing the formula \n)\n2\n.1\n(\nlog\n).\n2\n(log\n).\n1\n(log\n10\n2\n10\n1\n10\np\np\nT\np\nT\np\nT\nv\nv\nv\n\n\n \n \nWhere p1, p2 are pressure levels (p2<p1), Tv1, Tv2 are virtual temperatures at p1 and p2 \nrespectively.  \n \nApplication parameters from sounder derived products \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n368\nThis may be carried out starting from the surface to subsequent levels in steps of one \npressure level each. \n \n1.5 Outputs \n \n1.5.1 Format of the output and the domain \nLatitude, Longitude, Pressure (1000 to 0.1 hPa), GPH. \nDomain: 50 S to 50 N, 30 E to 130 E. \n \n1.6 Validation \n1.6.1 Data required \nCo located radiosonde measurements of temperature, humidity and geopotential heights. \nGeopotential heights from NCEP/ECMWF reanalysis. \n \n1.6.2 Methods of Validation \nDifference between radiosonde/reanalysis geopotential heights, mean bias, standard \ndeviation etc are calculated. \n \n1.7 Technical Issues (limitation etc.) \nAccuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the retrieved temperature and \nhumidity profiles.

To \na first approximation, error in \nvT   is of the same order of T. Hence achieving less than 10 \nm error in 500 hPa geopotential height demands that errors in retrieved temperatures be \nless than 0.5 K. \n \n1.8 References \nMeteorology For Scientists and Engineers, Roland Stull, 2000, Brookes/Cole (Pub.), 502 \npp. \nParameter \nUnit \nMin \nMax \nAccuracy \nResolution \nGPH \nMeters \n- \n- \n+/- 10 m \n0.5 x 0.5 deg \nApplication parameters from sounder derived products \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n369\n21.2.

It is calculated in the following steps. \n1. Mean boundary layer (usually lowest 100 hPa layer) temperature and humidity \nare calculated. \n2. A parcel of air with the above calculated temperature and humidity is lifted from \nthe middle of the boundary layer dry adiabatically up to lifting condensation level \nand then moist adiabatically up to 500 hPa. \n3. The environmental temperature minus the parcel temperature at 500 hPa \ncalculated in the above step is the lifted index (LI). \nIf the parcel temperature is warmer than the environmental temperature it indicates that \nthe parcel can rise further on its own and LI will be negative. Based on a large number of \nLI calculations from radiosonde observations, it is observed that LI less than -5 implies a \nvery strong likelihood of thunderstorm activity. Time sequence of geographical pattern of \nLI may be monitored to study large scale convective activity and its relation to synoptic \ncirculation systems (Hayden et al., 1996). \n \n3.2.2 Objective \nTo calculate Lifted Index (LIS) from temperature and humidity profiles retrieved from \nthe INSAT sounder. \n3.3 Inputs \n3.3.1 Dynamic Data \nSounder retrieved temperature and humidity profiles at standard pressure levels. \n \n3.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications \n3.4.1 Overview \n3.4.1.1 Theoretical Background \n Given boundary layer pressure, specific humidity and temperature, one can lift the parcel \nto 500 hPa dry adiabatically up to lifting condensation level (LCL) and from LCL to 500 \nhPa moist adiabatically and thereby compute the parcel temperature at 500 hPa. \nEnvironmental temperature at 500 hPa is the retrieved temperature at 500 hPa.

In regions such as the western Great Plains of the United States (e.g. near \nDenver), the environmental air is often so dry that evaporative cooling causes dangerous \ndowndraft called downbursts. Hazardous downbursts can occur even under cloud bases \nwhere precipitation evaporates before reaching the ground. The smaller-diameter but \nintense downbursts are called microbursts. Downbursts of 0.5 to 5 km in diameter have \nbeen observed. For extreme cases, downdraft speeds of nearly 10 m/s have been observed \n100 m above ground. This is particularly hazardous to landing and departing aircraft, \nbecause this vertical velocity can sometimes exceed aircraft climb rate. Doppler radars \ncan detect some of the downbursts and give early warning to pilots (Roland Stull, 2000). \nIn India dry desert regions, elevated plains, mountain regions where air is very dry may \nbe susceptible to microburst. Generally dry microburst occurs in situations characterized \nby high convective cloud bases and strong evaporational cooling in the sub-cloud layer, \nresulting in little or no precipitation at the surface.  \n \n4.2.2 Objective \nTo compute dry microburst index based on an empirical formula. \n4.3 Inputs \n \n4.3.1 Dynamic Data \nRetrieved temperature and humidity profile at standard pressure levels. \n \n4.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications \n4.4.1 Overview \n4.4.1.2 Theoretical Background \nDry microburst index is generally calculated using the formula,  \n500\n700\n)\n(\n)\n(\nd\nd\nT\nT\nT\nT\nDMI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nApplication parameters from sounder derived products \nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 \n \n375\n - lapse rate (oC km-1) of the layer from 700 hPa to melting level (i.e. layer at 0o C), T – \nTemperature (oC), Td – Dew point (oC).

Introduction \nIndia successfully launched its advanced meteorological satellite INSAT-3DR on 26th September \n2016 in the geostationary orbit at 74E. The inheritance of this satellite has come from INSAT-3D \nsatellite. Meteorological payloads onboard INSAT-3DR are a 6 channel Imager and a 19 channel \nSounder mainly for atmospheric profiles, cyclone and monsoon monitoring, cloud motion vectors \nwinds, rainfall estimation, floods/intense precipitation monitoring, snow cover detection, \nmesoscale studies etc. Apart from a 19 channel Sounder in INSAT-3D/3DR, the Imager has a split-\nwindow (TIR1/2), mid-IR (MIR) window, and shortwave IR (SWIR) channels in additions to \nearlier INSAT-3A/Kalpana VHRR. Details of the INSAT-3D/3DR Imager channels are given in \nTable-1. The spectral response functions (SRF) of TIR1 &2, MIR and WV bands of INSAT-3D \nare shown in figure (1) along with brightness temperature spectra of Infrared Atmospheric \nSounding Interferometer (IASI) for a standard tropical atmosphere. \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 \n \n3 \n \nTable-1: Imager channels’ characteristics \nBand# (Name) \nWavelength(μm) Resolution (km) SNR or NEDT (K) \n1 (VIS) \n0.52 – 0.72 \n1 \n150:1 \n2 (SWIR) \n1.55 – 1.70 \n1 \n150:1 \n3 (MIR) \n3.80 – 4.00 \n4 \n0.27 \n4 (WV) \n6.50 – 7.00 \n8 \n0.18 \n5 (TIR1) \n10.3 – 11.2 \n4 \n0.10 \n6 (TIR2) \n11.5 – 12.5 \n4 \n0.25 \n \n \nFig. 1: Convolved SRFs of infrared channels of INSAT-3D Imager superimposed on IASI Tb \nspectra \n \nSea surface temperature is derived from the split thermal window channels (10.3-11.2m, 11.5 –\n12.5m) during daytime and using additional midwave-IR window channel (3.8 – 4.0 m) during \nnighttime over cloud free oceanic regions. The most important part of the SST retrieval from IR \nobservations is the atmospheric correction. Especially over tropics, this atmospheric correction is \ndominated by the high variability in vertical distribution of the intervening atmospheric water \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 \n \n4 \n \nvapor. This correction is determined through suitable characterization of tropical atmosphere in \nthe radiative transfer model to simulate the brightness temperatures of INSAT-3D/3DR channels \nand then generating the regression coefficients for SST retrieval. Details of the algorithm have \nbeen given in section 3.1. \n \n2.1 Overview and background \nThis algorithm theoretical basis document (ATBD) describes the current operational algorithm for \nthe retrieval of sea surface temperature from INSAT-3D/3DR Imager channels data. While effort \nhas been made to make this document as complete as possible, it should be recognized that \nalgorithm development is an evolving process. This document (V1.1) is a description of the revised \nalgorithm for INSAT-3D/3DR sea surface temperature estimation as it currently exists, and is \nbeing delivered for inclusion in the INSAT-3D/3DR processing scheme. \nCurrent research on the physics of the atmospheric transmission in the infrared, the processes at \nthe ocean surface, and new information about the performance of the satellite will lead to periodic \nrevisions of the algorithms. Also, the document may appear incomplete in places as research \ncontinues to improve our understanding of the processes at work. Subsequent revisions of the \ndocument will reflect new knowledge and, it is hoped, fill the gaps in what is reported here.  \n \n2.2 Objective \nDevelopment of complete application software package for derivation of SST using multi-channel \nImager data from INSAT-3D/3DR.  \n \n2.3 Inputs \n2.3.1 Static Data \nParameter \nResolution \nAccuracy \nSource \nLand /Sea Mask \nPixel ( ~4 km) \n1 pixel \nUSGS(available) \nClimatological SST data \n0.25 X 0.25 degree \n0.5 K \nReynolds \n \n \n \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 \n \n5 \n \n2.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) \n \nParameter \nRes. \nQuant. \nAccuracy Source \nRadiometric \nand \ngeometric \ncorrected gray count values of  \nChannel-5  (10.2-11.3 m) \nPixel \n10 bit \n- \nDerived \nfrom \nraw data by DP \nRadiometric \nand \ngeometric \ncorrected gray count values of \nChannel-6 (11.5-12.5 m) \nPixel \n10 bit \n- \nDerived \nfrom \nraw data by DP \nRadiometric \nand \ngeometric \ncorrected gray count values of \nChannel-3 (3.8 – 4.0 m) \npixel \n10 bit \n- \nDerived \nfrom \nraw data by DP \nGray \nvalue \nto \nbrightness \ntemperature conversion lookup \ntable \n- \n- \n0.1 K \nDerived by DP \nGeolocation file \nPixel \n- \n1 pixel \nDerived by DP \nSatellite Zenith angle \nPixel \n \n \nDerived by DP \nSolar Zenith angle \nPixel \n \n \nDerived by DP \nCloud Flag \nPixel \n- \n- \nCloud Routine \n \n3. Algorithm Functional Specifications \n3.1 Overview \n3.1.1 Theoretical Background \nRadiance from Earth’s terrestrial emission peaks at around 10 m and it has minimum attenuation \nby atmospheric gases. Hence in order to measure earth’s surface temperature, space borne sensors \nare designed around this band (8-12m). Still this band is not completely transparent. Atmospheric \nwater vapour and CO2 are the major constituents that attenuate the IR signal reaching at the top of \nthe atmosphere in this wavelength band. Since CO2 is a uniformly mixed gas, its effect can be \ntaken care, but water vapour being highly variable in space and time needs additional information \non total water content in the atmosphere (directly or indirectly). Retrieval of sea surface \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 \n \n6 \n \ntemperature (SST) from thermal infrared window channels (10-12 m) requires atmospheric \ncorrection arising due to attenuation of signal by intervening moisture. This correction is more in \ntropics during summer due to higher amount of atmospheric moisture loading (Barton 1983, \nAnding and Kauth 1970, Gohil et al 1994, Mathur & Agarwal 1991, 2002, Shenoy 1999). The \nradiative transfer simulation studies, carried out using diverse training profiles set, have shown \nthat with proper characterization of water vapour in the atmosphere, a suitable algorithm can be \ndeveloped for accurate SST retrieval (<0.7K) using split thermal window and mid IR thermal \nchannels provided the sensor noise is of the order of 0.1K (Fig.2). The simplest of such algorithms \nassume that, for small cumulative amounts of water vapour, the atmosphere is sufficiently optically \nthin that the difference between the measured temperature in any band and the true surface \ntemperature can be parameterized as a simple function of the difference between the measured \ntemperatures in two bands with different atmospheric transmissions. \nLinear algorithms like Multi Channel Sea Surface Temperature (MCSST) are based on a formula \nof the following form for the surface temperature Ts. \n \n𝑇𝑠= 𝛼+ 𝛽𝑇𝑖+ 𝛾(𝑇𝑖−𝑇𝑗)     \n              (1) \n \nwhere, the Ti’s are the brightness temperatures in various bands for a given location and α, β and \nγ give the parametrized correction (Deschamps and Phulpin 1980, Llewellyn-Jones et al., 1984), \nor can be derived empirically from good composite sets of surface and satellite observations \n(Prabhakara, et al., 1974). \nAlthough Eq. (1) is easy to implement, it does not permit correction for changes in air mass due to \nscan-angle. Llewellyn-Jones et al., (1984) develop a table from numerical simulations which \npermits modification of Eq. (1) into a form: \n \n𝑇𝑠= 𝛼+ 𝛽′𝑇𝑖+ 𝛾′(𝑇𝑖−𝑇𝑗) + 𝛿(𝑠𝑒𝑐𝜃−1)             (2) \n \nwhere, θ is the satellite zenith angle and δ is an additional scan angle coefficient. This approach \nreduces the errors at large scan angles for moist atmospheres by more than 1K. This form, however, \nwhile improving the error behavior at large scan angles, does not adequately control the residual \nbehavior at high temperatures. \nA further generalization of this approach is to posit a non-linear structure for the SST estimator. \nFor that a NLSST (non-linear SST) atmospheric equation uses the form: \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 \n \n7 \n \n𝑆𝑆𝑇= 𝑎0 + 𝑎1𝑇1 + 𝑎2(𝑇1 −𝑇2) + 𝑎3(𝑇1 −𝑇2). (𝑇1 −𝑇2) + 𝑎4(𝑠𝑒𝑐𝜃−1). (𝑇1 −𝑇2)      (3) \n \nwhere, SST is the satellite derived SST estimate, T1 and T2 are the brightness temperatures of \nINSAT-3DR thermal channels (TIR-1 and TIR-2). a0, a1, a2, a3 and a4 are the retrieval coefficients \nestimated from the regression analysis using collocated simulated brightness temperatures and \nSST. The above equation (3) is currently operational at MOSDAC and IMD, Delhi. \nThe validation results of operational SST with in-situ and MODIS SST products has been \npresented in science team meeting of Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature \n(GHRSST) held at China during 05-09 June, 2017. In the meeting the Science Team members \nsuggested to drop the square term of the difference between brightness temperatures of TIR-1 & \nTIR-2, being used for correcting the atmospheric water vapour contamination. It was point out that \nif there is large noise in thermal channels, the square of their difference may result in large errors \nin SST, which was also observed on many occasions in the operational products. Therefore, based \non the recommendations from GHRSST Science Team and subsequent validation analysis of the \noperational SST products, the SST retrieval algorithm has been modified to address this issue of \nlarge errors in SST due to non-linear WV correction term. \nThe revised algorithm follows Walton et al. (1998) for SST retrieval which has the following form: \nDay-time:  \n \n𝑆𝑆𝑇= 𝑎0 + 𝑎1𝑇1 + 𝑎2(secθ −1) + 𝑎3𝑇𝑠𝑓𝑐. (𝑇1 −𝑇2) + 𝑎4(𝑠𝑒𝑐𝜃−1). (𝑇1 −𝑇2)       (4) \nNight-time: \n \n𝑆𝑆𝑇= 𝑎0 + 𝑎1𝑇3 + 𝑎2(secθ −1) + 𝑎3𝑇𝑠𝑓𝑐. (𝑇1 −𝑇2) + 𝑎4(𝑠𝑒𝑐𝜃−1). (𝑇1 −𝑇2)       (5) \nwhere, T3 is the brightness temperature of MIR channel. Tsfc is the a priori estimate of SST that can \nbe taken from the climatology or from the forecast of the numerical weather prediction models. \nAll other variables are same as in equation (3). The multiplication factor Tsfc is used to scale the \ncorrection factor due to atmospheric water vapor. We have also tried to experiment with the \nbrightness temperature of TIR1 as a multiplying factor, which yields very similar result. However, \nin order to avoid occasional large noise in the TIR1 BT we retain Tsfc as the multiplying factor as \nin the original algorithm proposed by Walton et al. (1998).  \n \n3.1.2 Radiative Transfer Model \nSince frequency bands and their spectral response functions of INSAT-3DR and INSAT-3D are \nalmost similar, the transmission coefficients file of INSAT-3D required to simulate brightness \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 \n \n8 \n \ntemperatures through PFAAST radiative transfer (RT) model can be used for simulating INSAT-\n3DR brightness temperatures. Therefore, we have simulated the brightness temperatures \ncorresponding to INSAT-3DR thermal and mid-IR channels through PFAAST RT model. The \natmospheric profiles and required surface variables has been taken from ECMWF diverse data set. \nThe simulations have been performed for the clear atmospheres over oceanic region spanning from \n0E – 130E and 60S – 60N only, and for satellite zenith angle from 0 to 60 degrees.  \n \n3.1.3 Cloud detection \nIn the present algorithm, the cloudy pixels are flagged using INSAT-3DR level-2 cloud mask \nproduct. In absence of the INSAT-3DR cloud mask product the cloudy pixels are detected through \ncloud mask routine based on threshold and spatial coherence techniques in visible, MIR and \nthermal bands. Threshold technique assumes that over oceans in Indian domain brightness \ntemperature in thermal band (TIR-1) is greatly affected by the presence of clouds, resulting in \ndecreased brightness temperature from cold cloud tops. Spatial coherence method is based on the \nassumption that SST is homogeneous in smaller spatial domain and sufficiently warmer than \nclouds; thus clouds can be identified where the scene brightness temperature has lower mean value \nor larger standard deviation. In addition to above the following thresholds criteria as described in \nATBD of MODIS (Ackerman et al., 2006) cloud mask product have also been used. \nDuring day time the reflection in MIR channels dominates over emission; therefore, in general \nMIR BT can be higher than TIR-1 BT by up to ~6K for clear-sky. However, for MIR channel the \nreflection coefficient is higher for cloud top than earth’s surface. Hence the difference of TIR1 and \nMIR BTs becomes more negative for cloudy sky. The visible reflectance is very high for clouds \nas compared to earth’s surface. Hence, higher visible albedo (>5 %) or reflectance corresponds to \ncloudy sky.  During day-time (solar zenith angle < 80 degree) the following threshold criterion has \nbeen used to detect cloudy pixels: \n𝑇1 −𝑇3 < −6.0 & (𝑣𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡> 70 𝑜𝑟 𝑎𝑙𝑏𝑒𝑑𝑜> 5) \nwhere, T1 and T3 are the brightness temperatures of TIR-1 and MIR channels of INSAT-3D/3DR, \nrespectively.  \nDuring night there is no solar reflection at MIR wavelength hence satellite measures only emitted \nradiation. Since cloud emissivity is lower for MIR as compared to TIR-1 wavelength, the \nbrightness temperature corresponding to MIR will be smaller than that of TIR-1 BT for cloudy \npixels. Hence, during night-time (solar zenith angle >= 80 degree) the following threshold is used \nto mask the cloudy pixels: \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 \n \n9 \n \n𝑇1 −𝑇3 > −1.0 \nSST is computed only over clear oceanic regions. \n \n3.1.4 Error Analysis \nA simulation based sensitivity study of noise in TIR-1 & TIR-2 channels’ BTs on the SST retrieval \nhas been carried out to analyze the errors in the retrieved SST. The simulations have been \nperformed through PFAAST radiative transfer model using atmospheric profiles from ECMWF \ndiverse training dataset for INSAT-3D spectral response functions. The following figure (2) is \nshowing the impact of noise in both the channels on the errors in the retrieved SST. From the figure \nit can be clearly pointed out that if both the channels have uncertainty of 0.1K, the theoretical error \nin retrieved SST would be ~ 0.7K. If uncertainty in both the channels is ~0.05K the minimum \npossible error in the retrieved SST would be 0~.55K.  \n \n \n \nFig. 2: Sensitivity of total noise in the retrieval of SST from INSAT-3D Imager \n \nIt can also be inferred from the figure (2) that using split-window channels the best possible SST \naccuracy of 0.5K could be achieved. For getting better than 0.5K accuracy, one should opt other \natmospheric WV correction techniques as used in ATSR mission which gives approximately 0.3K \n(Mutlow, et al., 1994; Minnett, 1988; Barton, et al., 1993) errors in retrieved SST. In ATSR dual-\nview configuration has been used to correct the atmospheric WV. The Superiority of the dual-view \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 \n \n10 \n \nalgorithm over single-view split-window algorithm lies in the fact that use of the cleaner window \nfor atmospheric correction using second view with larger path-length reduces the uncertainty that \narises in the split window algorithm due to larger uncertainties in the attenuation in the second \nsplit-window channel due to highly variable atmospheric water vapor. \n \n3.2 Algorithm Flowchart \n \n \n \nFig. 3: Flow-chart of SST Retrieval from INSAT-3DR Imager \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 \n \n11 \n \n3.3 Operational Implementation \nThe implementation is done in the following steps: \nStep-1. Reading of the grey counts, geolocation, satellite and solar zenith angles. \nStep-2. Determine brightness temperatures from grey counts using the lookup table. \nStep-3. Mask the land pixels using land/sea mask. \nStep-4. Processing for discrimination between brightness temperatures from cloud free sea surface \nand those from the cloud tops as discussed in section 3.1.3. \nStep-5. Computation of SST \nFor cloud-free pixels, SST is computed as \n𝑆𝑆𝑇= 𝑎0 + 𝑎1𝑇1 + 𝑎2(𝑠𝑒𝑐𝜃−1) + 𝑎3𝑇𝑠𝑓𝑐. (𝑇1 −𝑇2) + 𝑎4(𝑠𝑒𝑐𝜃−1).

Tsfc has been taken from the daily SST climatology.  \nStep-6. Quality control/Editing of derived SST \nOnly those SST values will be retained for which the following condition holds: \n(𝑆𝑆𝑇𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑚−3𝜎) ≤𝑆𝑆𝑇≤(𝑆𝑆𝑇𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑚+ 3𝜎) \nwhere, σ is the standard deviation of the daily climatological SST and SSTclim is the daily value of \nclimatological SST. \n \n3.4 Output \nSST maps and data (HDF5) are available every half hourly, daily, weekly, monthly and seasonally. \n \nParameter \nMin (K) \nMax (K) Theoretical Accuracy \nResolution \n \nSST(day) \n \n285 \n \n310 \n~0.7-0.8 K \n(with 0.10-0.15 K \nnoise) \nPixel (~4 km) \n \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 \n \n12 \n \n3.4.1 Format of the output and the domain \nHDF5 data sets : Latitude, Longitude, SST, Quality flag \n \nDomain : 400 S to 400 N, 300 E to 1200 E \n \n3.5 Validation \nThe extensive validation of the derived SST will be done using all the available data from buoys, \nspecial cruise by research vessels and available similar products from various satellite missions.  \n \n3.5.1 Initial validation  \nPreliminary validation of SST retrieved through the proposed algorithm for both INSAT-3D & \n3DR with concurrent in-situ as well as MODIS/Aqua SST been performed for 11-18 December, \n2017. Comparison of operational products have also been performed with same in-situ SST data \nfor the same period. We have taken 0.040 spatial resolution and 15 minutes’ temporal resolution \nfor collocation. The daily products have also been compared with GHRSST (Group for High \nResolution SST) daily SST products for the same period. \n \n3.5.1.1 Comparison with in-situ: \nThe in situ records acquired from In-situ quality monitor (Iquam) portal hosted by National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are first temporally matched-up against the \nINSAT-3D/3DR extractions. To limit variability introduced by the time separation between the \ntwo data sources, the absolute difference between the time of the in situ SST measurement and the \ntime at which that location is viewed by the INSAT-3D/3DR (i.e., the matchup time window) is \nrestricted to a maximum of ±15 minutes. In situ records that do not fall within the stipulated time \nwindow will be rejected. The in situ records that pass the temporal matchup subsequently have to \npass a spatial test.  \nThe figures 4(a) and 4(b) are showing the scatter plot of INSAT-3D SST retrieved through new \nand operational algorithm with respect to concurrent in-situ SST measurements while figures 5(a) \nand 5(b) are showing the same for INSAT-3DR SST. \n \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 \n \n13 \n \n      \n \n                          (a) \n \n \n                                            (b) \nFig. 4: Scatter plot of INSAT-3D SST with in-situ SST (a) Operational (b) New \n \n      \n    \n \n              (a) \n \n \n \n       \n                     (b)  \n \nFig. 5: Scatter plot of INSAT-3DR SST with in-situ SST (a) Operational (b) New \nFrom above figures (4) and (5), it can be seen that the spread is less in new SST as compared to \noperational SST when compared with same in-situ data for both satellites. This clearly indicates \nan improvement in SST when retrieved using proposed algorithm than the operational SST. The \ncorrelation coefficient also shows an improvement.  \n \n \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 \n \n14 \n \n3.5.1.2 Comparison with MODIS/Aqua: \nA preliminary comparison of SST retrieved using new as well as operational algorithm for both \nINSAT-3D & 3DR satellites has been carried out with MODIS/Aqua SST for the same period of \n11-18, December 2017.

From the above figures it is clear that both the bias and Std of new SST are less than \nthat of operational SST when compared with MODIS. Therefore, SST accuracy is improved when \nretrieved using the proposed algorithm.  \n \n3.5.2.3 Comparison with GHRSST DAILY Products: \nAn initial comparison of daily SST products retrieved using new as well as operational algorithm \nfor both INSAT-3D & 3DR satellites has been carried out with GHRSST daily SST products for \nthe same period of 11-18, December 2017. The comparison has been shown by the spatial plots of \nthe differences in both the SST products. The following figures (8) and (9) are showing the spatial \nplots of the differences for INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR, respectively for 11th December 2017.  \n \n    \n     \n \n                    (a) \n \n \n \n                            (b) \nFig. 8: Difference of daily INSAT-3D SST with GHRSST (a) Operational (b) New  \n \nIt can be clearly seen from the above figures (8) and (9) that except some locations the difference \nbetween INSAT-3D/3DR SST and GHRSST is within ±1K when retrieved through proposed \nalgorithm. While the difference between operational SST and GHRSST products is as high as 2.5 \nto 3K in case of INSAT-3D and as low as -2.5 to -3K in case of INSAT-3DR. This clearly indicates \nthe superiority of the proposed algorithm over the operational one. \n \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 \n \n16 \n \n     \n      \n                               (a)  \n \n \n \n                            (b)  \nFig. 9: Difference of daily INSAT-3DR SST with GHRSST (a) Operational (b) New \n \n3.6 Applications \nThere are many potential applications of SST.

Biases in radiative transfer model \nsimulations can be accounted for by validating the derived SST with reliable and concurrent in-\nsitu data. In the absence of split thermal window channel observations and a channel sensitive to \nintervening atmospheric total water vapour content, the atmospheric correction applied is an \nindirect. The accuracy of this correction will heavily depend upon the accuracy of the model \nreanalysis for total water vapour. Major constraints  on data quality outside the scope of this effort \nfocus in the following areas: accurate pre-launch instrument characterization, instrument NEΔT \nfor each band, calibration model performance, availability of quality controlled surface calibration-\nvalidation observations, availability and access to the various quality assessment data sets, and \ntimely access to continuing performance assessment data sets. The on-orbit instrument NEΔT \nperformance is a primary input to the algorithm error budget.  \n \n3.7 Future Scope \nInitially, this proposed algorithm and bias correction would be used to derive SST. Over a period \nof approximately one year, after complete calibration and validation of the product, bias correction \nand other fine tuning of the coefficients would be carried out. This should  improve the accuracy \nof the product to the desired level. Of course, instrument noise also plays a crucial role in \ndetermining the overall accuracy of the product. Generation of regression coefficients for SST \nretrieval from simultaneous satellite and buoy observations data base require nearly 250 buoys \ndistributed over Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean continuously for minimum 2/3 \nyears.  \nMoreover, the bias correction as mentioned above is based on the simulated brightness \ntemperatures using ECMWF analysis profiles and PFAAST RT model. Also, ECMWF analysis \nprofiles may also have some biases which can cause the biases in the simulated brightness \ntemperatures. Therefore, in future we will refine this bias correction using radiosonde based \natmospheric profiles. Similarly, RT models also known to have inherent biases. Hence, better RT \nmodel like OPTRON will also be explored to reduce the RT model biases.  \n \n \n \n \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018 \n \n19 \n \nReferences: \n1 \nAckerman Steve, Kathleen Strabala, Paul Menzel, Richard Frey, Chris Moeller, Liam \nGumley, Bryan Baum, Suzanne Wetzel Seemann, and Hong Zhang (2006), “Discriminating \nClear-sky from Cloud with MODIS Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (MOD35).” \n2 \nAnding D. and R.

Singh and \nNaveen Tripathi \nSnow Cover Mapping & Fractional \nSnow Cover \n \n2.2. Introduction \nAlgorithms is developed to map snow cover using INSAT 3D(R) Meteorological payload. The \nsnow mapping algorithm uses a grouped-criteria technique using the Normalized Difference Snow \nIndex (NDSI) and other spectral threshold tests to identify snow on a pixel-by-pixel basis, and to \nmap snow cover in dense forests. The NDSI is useful for snow mapping, as snow reflects strongly \nin the visible region but absorbs in the short-wave IR (SWIR) part of the spectrum. The reflectance \nof clouds is high in the visible as well as short-wave IR. This characteristic is used to identify and \nmap snow cover. Coarse resolution binary snow product from INSAT 3D imager will be further \nused to generate fractional snow cover product in synchronous with available high resolution snow \ncover products.  \nValidation of the INSAT snow maps will be carried out using snow products of AWiFS data of \nResourcesat1/2 and a limited amount of field measurements. In addition, validation will also be \ncarried out using visual interpretation and the MODIS derived snow maps. The accuracy of the \nsnow maps may vary with land-cover type. Hence, the Snow map algorithm has been and will \ncontinue to be tested for a variety of land covers. Error estimates have been determined from field \nmeasurements for different land covers, and these errors are used to estimate the expected \nmaximum monthly and annual errors in Himalayan snow mapping using the algorithm. \n \n \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 14 \n \n1.2.1. Overview and background \nThe purpose of the snow-mapping algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow cover product from \nINSAT 3D(R) data. This algorithm is based on the ratio techniques, which was used successfully \nto monitor snow using AWiFS data of Resourcesat-1. Daily snow and 10 days snow covered digital \nmap products will be generated.  \nSnow covers almost 40 per cent of the Earth's land surface during Northern Hemisphere winter. \nThis makes snow albedo and area an important component of the Earth's radiation balance (Foster \nand Chang, 1993).  Large areas in the Himalayas are covered by snow during winter time. Area of \nsnow can change significantly during winter and spring. This can affect stream flow during spring \nand summer of the rivers originating in the Higher Himalayas. In addition, snow pack ablation is \nhighly sensitive to climatic variation. Increase in atmospheric temperature can influence snowmelt \nand stream runoff pattern (Kulkarni et al. 2002a). Therefore, mapping of areal extent and \nreflectance of snow is an important parameter for various climatological and hydrological \napplications. In addition, extent of snow cover can also be used as an input for avalanche \ninvestigation. \nSnow was first observed in April 1960 by TIROS-1 satellite in eastern Canada. Since then, the \npotential for operational satellite-based mapping has been enhanced by the development of higher \ntemporal-frequency and satellite sensors with higher spatial resolution. In addition, satellite \nsensors with better radiometric resolutions, such as MODIS and AWiFS have been used \nsuccessfully for snow mapping (Hall et al. 2002; Kulkarni et al. 2006). This is possibly due to \ndistinct spectral reflectance characteristics of snow in visible and short wave infrared region. \nInformation generated from satellite observations has been extensively used for snowmelt runoff \nmodeling (Kulkarni et al. 2002b). Remote sensing technique has been extensively used for snow \ncover monitoring in the Himalayan region with the help of numerous satellite sensors (Kulkarni \nand Rathore, 2003). Various analysis techniques as visual, hybrid (Visual and supervised \nclassification) have been used to estimate areal extent of snow cover (Kulkarni and Rathore, 2003). \nHowever, major difficulty in snow cover monitoring using automated technique in the Himalayan \nregion is mountain shadow and confusing signature of snow and cloud in the visible and near \ninfrared region. Because of above-mentioned reasons, combination of digital and visual \ninterpretation technique is needed to monitor snow cover. This makes snow cover mapping \ncumbersome and time consuming. To overcome this problem normalized difference snow index \nmethod is developed and discussed in this document. In optical region snow reflectance is higher \nas compared to other land features as grass, rock and water. However, in SWIR region snow \nreflectance is lower than rock and vegetation (Kulkarni et al. 2002c). Therefore, snow on satellite \nimages appears white in visible and black in SWIR region.  This characteristic has been effectively \nused to develop Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) for snow cover mapping (Hall et al. \n1995).  \n \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 15 \n \n1.2.2. Remote Sensing of Snow Cover \nOne of the earliest methods used for snow cover monitoring was visual interpretation. During this \ninvestigation Large Format Optical Enlarger was used and investigation was carried out using band \n2 of Landsat MSS and IRS LISS-I sensor. The investigation was extensively used for snow cover \nmonitoring in Malan, Tosh and many small basins in the Himalayas (Kulkarni et al. 2004).  \nThis technique was further modified with advancement of Digital Analysis Technique and \navailability of higher frequency satellite data such as WiFS of IRS and VHRR of NOAA satellite. \nIn this technique, a combination of visual and digital analysis was used. This was necessary \nbecause mountain shadows in the months from November to February normally make it difficult \nto use only digital technique for snow cover delineation. From the month of March mountain \nshadows are negligible and snow extent can be estimated from supervised classification technique. \nThis technique has been extensively used to map snow cover in Western Himalaya, Baspa and \nSatluj basins (Kulkarni and Rathore, 2003).  \nAnother major difficulty in snow cover monitoring is cloud cover. It is further compounded due to \nsimilar reflectance characteristics of snow and cloud. The discrimination between snow and cloud \ncan be done by using various techniques such as textural analysis, association with shadow and by \nusing multi temporal analysis. In Himalayas and in present investigation, snow/cloud \ndiscrimination was done by using texture, where snow shows characteristic mountainous pattern, \nwhich cannot be seen when area is cloud covered.  In visible and near infrared region reflectance \nof snow and cloud is very high. Therefore, discrimination between snow and cloud is not possible. \nThis is because of similar reflectance characteristics in this region. In spectral range between 1.55-\n1.75 m, 2.1-2.35 m and 3.55-3.93 m have shown potential for snow/cloud discrimination. In \nthese bands, snow has lower reflectance than cloud. Spectral region between 1.55-1.75 m has \nbeen successfully used to separate certain types of clouds from snow (Kulkarni et al. 2006). \nReflectance of fresh snow is very high in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, but \ndecreases in the near-IR especially as grain size increases (O'Brien and Munis, 1975; Warren and \nWiscombe, 1980; Srinivasulu et al. 2002). In addition, soot from industrial pollution becomes \nincorporated into the snowpack and this may decrease albedo and enhance snowmelt (Clarke and \nNoone, 1985; Negi et al. 2006). Both because of natural aging and other factors (e.g. soot or \nvolcanic ash deposition), the reflectance of snow decreases over time. Fresh snow can have a \nreflectance (integrated over the reflective part of the spectrum) up to about 80 percent but its \nreflectance may decrease to below 40 percent after snow crystals metamorphose.  \nSnow, like all natural surfaces, is an anisotropic reflector (Nolin and Liang, 2000). The reflectance \nfrom snow is high in the forward direction and is largely specular. While freshly fallen snow can \nbe nearly a Lambertian reflecting surface, as snow metamorphoses the specular component \ncharacteristic of forward scattering increases. \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 16 \n \n1.2.3. Objective \nThe purpose of the snow-mapping algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow cover product from \nINSAT 3D(R) data. This algorithm is based on Normalised Difference Snow Index method, which \nwas used successfully to monitor snow using AWiFS data of Resourcesat. Daily snow and \nmaximum 10-day snow covered area digital-map products will be generated.  \nThis algorithm will be further modified, with NDVI adopted from other sources and infrared \nbrightness temperature to identify snow in forest covers and identify cloud pixels, respectively.  \n1.3.

Algorithm Functional Specifications \n1.4.1. Overview \nA grouped-criteria technique incorporating NDSI and threshold-based criterion for the algorithm \nwas selected for the following reasons:  \n Sensors with better radiometric resolutions, such as MODIS and AWiFS, have been used for \ngenerating the snow products using similar algorithm. (Hall et al., 1995; Kulkarni et al., 2006; \nSingh et al., 2013; Rathore et al., 2015).   \n The technique can map snow under mountain shadow and independent of local solar \nillumination angle. It makes this algorithm highly suitable for mountainous terrain as \nHimalayas (Kulkarni et al. 2006). \n INSAT 3D(R) Met payloads has a channel in 1.55 to 1.75 m with 1 km spatial resolution. \nSimilar channel is not available on GOES satellite. In addition, channel number INSAT 3D(R) \n1&2 channels are having 1 km spatial resolution. Therefore, product can be generated at 1 km \nresolution.  \n SWIR reflectance/Brightness temperature will be used to identify certain type of clouds which \nwere not separated using NDSI threshold. Threshold values will be fine-tuned. This will be \ninitially established using Spectral Reflectance library of Space Applications Centre and then \nsensitivity analysis of INSAT-3D(R) data. \n AWiFS derived snow cover products will be used to estimate snow part in synchronous INSAT \npixel to develop approach for estimating fractional snow cover product for INSAT data. \nIt runs automatically, without human intervention. It is straightforward, computationally frugal, \nand thus easy for the user to understand exactly how the product is generated.  \nSnow has strong visible reflectance and strong short-wave IR absorbing characteristics. The \nNormalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) is an effective way to distinguish snow from many \nother surface features. Both sunlit and some shadowed snow is mapped effectively. A similar index \nfor vegetation, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been proven to be \neffective for monitoring global vegetation conditions throughout the year (Tucker, 1979 and 1986). \nAdditionally, some snow/cloud discrimination is accomplished using the NDSI.  \nOther promising techniques, such as traditional supervised multispectral classifications, spectral-\nmixture modeling, or neural-network analyses have not yet been shown to be usable for automatic \napplication at the mountainous region. They are also computationally intensive. Training or the \ninteraction of an interpreter is required for successful application of techniques such as neural-\nnetwork analysis. These techniques may progress to regional applications and possibly even global \napplication in future years. \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 18 \n \nIn fractional snow cover, presently snow cover products derived using AWiFS data will be used to \ndevelop the approach. INSAT derived snow was matched with synchronous AWiFS snow pixels \nwhich was used to develop a relationship for snow fraction of INSAT pixel.   \n1.4.2. Theoretical Background \n 1.4.2.1. Snow cover map \nThe snow-cover mapping algorithm is designed to identify snow in each 1 km pixel. A regional, \ndaily snow product will be produced. A 10-day composite snow cover product will be generated \nby compositing successive days of snow cover products. This will yield maximum snow extent for \nthe 10-day period. If a pixel were snow covered on any orbit during that period, then that pixel \nwill be mapped as snow covered even if it were snow-free on all of the other orbits during the 10-\nday period. Other coverage and persistence statistics will also be included to assist analysis of the \ndata product.  \nThere has been much discussion concerning the optimum composite period for the snow maps \n(Kulkarni et al, 2006). While weekly composites would correspond with the NOAA/NESDIS maps \nand the NOHRSC maps, some modelers are interested in longer composition periods, e.g., 7 days \nto one month. 8-day composites were chosen because this period optimizes the ground coverage \nfrom the MODIS instrument. In India, the hydrological data analysis is carried out on 10-daily \nbasis; therefore 10-day composite will be prepared.  If a researcher wants to produce a composite \nproduct for any period other than a 10-day period, from our daily product, this can be done using \nthe daily data.  \n1.4.2.2.  Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) \nThe NDSI is useful for the identification of snow and for separating snow and most cumulus \nclouds. The NDSI is a measure of the relative magnitude of the characteristic reflectance difference \nbetween the visible and short-wave IR reflectance of snow. The NDSI is insensitive to a wide range \nof illumination conditions (Kulkarni et al. 2006). The NDSI is analogous to the normalized-\ndifference vegetation index (NDVI) (Tucker, 1979 and 1986; Townshend and Tucker, 1984). NDSI \ncan be computed as given below; \n  \nNDSI = (VisibleINSAT B1 - SWIRINSAT B2) / (VisibleINSAT B1 + SWIRINSAT B2)  \nPixels that are approximately 75% or greater covered by snow were found to have NDSI values \nmore than 0.4 in our field investigation at Dhundi test site in Himachal Pradesh (Negi et al. 2006). \nThese NDSI thresholds have been verified from detailed analysis of numerous AWiFS scenes, \ncomparisons with supervised-classification techniques and NDSI technique. (Kulkarni et al, 2004). \nPure snow has a high NDSI but NDSI decreases as other features are mixed in a pixel. Snow in \nmixed pixels has an NDSI that is less than that for pure snow. Pure snow can be distinguished by \nits high NDSI value (Negi et al. 2006).  Since bandwidth of AWiFS band 1 and INSAT 3D(R) \nimager is different, initially NDSI threshold value will be established using Field Spectral Data \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 19 \n \nLibrary of Space Applications Centre (Singh et al. 2005 and Negi et al. 2006). This will be further \nevaluated during post launch period, by carrying out sensitivity analysis (Kulkarni et al. 2006).  \nIn forested locations, many snow covered pixels have an NDSI lower than 0.4. To correctly classify \nthese forests as snow covered, a lower NDSI threshold is necessary (Negi et al. 2006). NDVI and \nNDSI will be used together in order to discriminate between snow-free and snow covered forests. \nForested pixels have higher NDVI values compared with non-forested pixels. Thus by using the \nNDSI and NDVI in combination, it is possible to lower the NDSI threshold in forested areas \nwithout compromising the algorithm performance for other land covers. Since appropriate bands \nare not available in INSAT 3D(R) payload, mask will be used from other existing source. \nSince water may also have an NDSI 0.4, therefore permanent mask is necessary to separate water \nfrom snow. \n1.4.2.3. Snow / Cloud Discrimination \nSnow/cloud-discrimination techniques are based on differences between cloud and snow \nreflectance and emittance characteristics. Clouds are highly variable and may be detected by their \ngenerally high reflectance in the visible and near-IR parts of the electromagnetic spectrum \n(Kulkarni et al. 2002a), whereas the reflectance of snow drops in the short-wave infrared part of \nthe spectrum.  \nWhile the NDSI can separate snow from most obscuring clouds, it does not always identify or \ndiscriminate optically-thin cirrus clouds from snow. Analyses of AWiFS and MODIS data show \nthat NDSI can map snow under cirrus clouds at least some of the time. Cirrus clouds have high \nreflectance in SWIR region than snow which requires fine tuning of threshold value and will be \nused as an additional criterion in present approach. This algorithm will further be improved due to \navailability of thermal bands in INSAT 3D(R) Met payload. Appropriate brightness temperature \nthreshold will be used to separate cloud from snow (Romanov and Tarpley, 2003) or cloud removal \nwill also be tested using cloud mask product subject to its availability as an additional INSAT \n3D(R) derived product. This will be additional criteria than in built criteria of NDSI. \n  \n \n \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 20 \n \n1.4.2.4.

Sensitivity analysis to establish NDSI threshold \nIn order to establish credible threshold value of NDSI for snow cover mapping, sensitivity tests of \nindividual threshold values were carried out. Sensitivity analysis will be carry out to identify NDSI \nthreshold for INSAT 3D(R) snow products. This threshold value will also be verified using FFC \ncombination for snow covered area identification.  \n1.4.2.6. Fraction Snow Cover \nSnow binary product of INSAT 3D data, available at coarse resolution, will be used to convert into \nfractional snow cover which will be helpful to improve the snow cover areal extent based on \noccupancy of that pixel in terms of actual snow fraction present in respective pixel of INSAT 3D. \nSynchronous INSAT and high resolution satellite derive NDSI and snow cover product were \nselected for the winter season. Different months and terrain in Himalayan region was chosen to \nrepresent to take care possible scenarios. INSAT derived NDSI and snow pixel was compared with \nNDSI and snow pixel for high resolution data to develop a relationship between NDSI and snow \ncover areal extent for coarse and fine resolution datasets. This develop relationship will be used to \ngenerate fractional snow cover area for INSAT dataset and will be helpful to improve daily snow \ncover areal extent from geostationary platform.      \n1.4.3. Operational Implementation \nStep 1 : Conversion from gray count to Reflectance and BT: \nIn this step, the DN values will be converted into Radiance, Reflectance and Brightness \ntemperature using calibration coefficient available with INSAT 3D(R) data. The radiometrically \nprocessed data will also be geolocated and this will provide a radiometrically and geometrically \ncorrected product to be used further in algorithm. \nStep 2 : Cloud elimination \nThis step includes the cloud screening from the INSAT 3D(R) image. Cloud screening is based on \nSWIR reflectance/temperature data, or cloud mask product will be used subject to its availability, \nand this will help to clear cloudy pixels. \nStep 3 : Generation of NDSI image \nNormalized Difference Snow Index will be computed using the normalized ratio of visible and \nSWIR channel as given below; \nNDSI = (R INSAT B1 – R INSAT B2) / (R INSAT B1 – R INSAT B2) \nwhere R is the reflectance of the respective channel. \nStep 4: Generation of Fractional snow pixel \nA developed relationship will be used to convert INSAT 3D coarse resolution pixel into fractional \nsnow cover pixel for the respective pixel. \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 22 \n \nAccuracy of SCM and FSC is expected to be approximately 90% or better.   \n1.5.

Comparison of INSAT 3D(R) snow maps with AWiFS snow products  \nINSAT-derived snow maps will continue to be compared with snow cover maps generated by \nAWiFS. In addition, comparisons will be made between MODIS maps. Comparison of Snowmap \nresults with these independently produced snow data sets will allow errors to be identified that will \npermit us to determine the accuracy of the global maps relative to one another.  \n \n1.7.

Introduction \nNear-real-time estimates of biomass burning emissions are crucial for air quality monitoring. This \nalgorithm theoretical basis document (ATBD) provides a description of new fire characterization \nscience product, specifically named as, biomass burning emission product (BBEP) utilizing the \nINSAT-3D/3DR Imager.  The INSAT active fire algorithm is a dynamic multispectral thresholding \ncontextual algorithm that is based on the sensitivity of the 3.9 μm (MIR channel) to high \ntemperature sub-pixel anomalies relative to the less sensitive 10.8 μm (TIR-1 Channel). The \ncurrent operational version of the INSAT fire product provides information on the location of the \nfire pixel only. In order to characterize the fire in terms of BBEP further details like estimates of \ninstantaneous sub-pixel fire size, temperature, and radiative power; ecosystem type; and a \nclassification flag needs to be worked out at pixel level.  The fire properties are coupled to each \nother, one cannot calculate an instantaneous fire size without estimating a fire temperature, and \nfire radiative power (FRP) is a function of size and temperature. The algorithm will work upon \naccurate estimation of satellite-derived fire radiative power (FRP) for individual fire pixels. The \nINSAT-3D/3DR satellites observe wildfires at an interval of 15–30 min. Because of the impacts \nfrom sensor saturation, thin cloud cover, and background surface, the FRP values will not be \ncontinuously observed. The missing observations will be simulated by combining the available \ninstantaneous FRP observations within a day and a set of representative climatological diurnal \npatterns of FRP for various ecosystems (evergreen forests, semi-evergreen and deciduous forests \nwith their densities like dense, medium and open forests). Finally, the simulated diurnal variation \nin FRP will be applied to quantify biomass combustion and emissions in individual fire pixels with \na latency of 1 day (0300 UTC – 0230 UTC for INSAt-3D & 0315 UTC to 0245 UTC for 3DR; \nfollowing day). It is expected that near-real-time hourly emissions from BBEP would provide a \ncrucial component for atmospheric and chemical transport modelers to forecast air quality and \nweather conditions. \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 27 \n \n2.3. Algorithm Overview \nBiomass burning emissions can be modeled using four fundamental parameters; burned area, fuel \nloading (biomass density), the fraction of biomass combustion, and the factors of emissions for \ntrace gases and aerosols. By integrating these parameters, biomass burning emissions can be \nestimated using the following formula (Seiler and Crutzen, 1980): \nE = DM * F = A * B * C * F ………………….(1) \nWhere, E = emissions from biomass burning (kg);  \nDM = dry fuel mass combusted (kg);  \nF = factor of consumed biomass that is released as trace gases and smoke particulates \nA = burned area (km2);  \nB = biomass density (kg/km2);  \nC = fraction of biomass consumed during a fire event.  \n \nThis simple model has been widely applied to estimate fire emissions in local, regional, and global \nscales (Ito and Penner, 2004; Reid et al., 2004; Wiedinmyer et al., 2006; van der Werf et al., 2006; \nZhang et al., 2008). The accuracy of the emissions depends strongly on the quality of fuel loading \nand burned area estimates, which have high uncertainties (Zhang et al., 2008; van der Werf et al., \n2010; French et al., 2011). Alternatively, Wooster, 2002 demonstrated a linear relationship between \nfuel consumption and total emitted fire radiative energy. This is due to the fact that the total amount \nof energy released per unit mass of dry fuel fully burned is weakly dependent on vegetation types \nand fuel types, which ranges between 16 and 22 MJ/kg (Lobert and Warnatz, 1993; Whelan, 1995; \nTrollope et al., 1996; Wooster et al., 2005). Thus, biomass burning emission is linearly linked to \nfire radiative energy in a simple formula (Wooster, 2002): \n……………………..(2) \nWhere; FRP = fire radiative power (MW);  \nFRE = fire radiative energy (MJ);  \nt1 and t2 = beginning and ending time (second) of a fire event;  \nβ = biomass combustion rate (kg/MJ) \nF = emission factor (g/kg for CO and PM2.5) \nFRE represents the combination of total burned area and the dry fuel mass combusted (e.g., live \nfoliage, branches, dead leaf litter, and woody materials) in a given time period, which reduces error \nsources of parameter measurements comparing with the first approach (eq.1) employing both \nburned area and fuel loading in the estimates of biomass burning emissions. Thus, the FRP \napproach will be better to produce BBEP. \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 28 \n \n2.3.1 Algorithm flowchart (FRP approach) \nOnce a fire is identified, Fire Radiative Power (FRP) estimation algorithm will be applied. FRP is \ntheoretically a function of fire size and fire temperature. It is empirically related to the difference \nof brightness temperature between a fire pixel and ambient background pixels at the middle \ninfrared (MIR) band (Kaufman et al., 1998). Further, FRP is approximated as the difference of \nMIR spectral radiances between a fire pixel and ambient background pixels in a linear form \n(Wooster et al., 2003). The proposed method is based on the assumption that Fire Radiative Power \n(FRP) is empirically related to the difference of brightness temperature between a fire pixel and \nambient background pixels at the middle infrared (MIR) channel. Biomass burning emission will \nbe computed using eq.2 (Wooster, 2002) below: \nE = ∫\u0002\u0003\n\u0002\u0004 FRPdt x ß x F \nβ is biomass combustion rate (kg/MJ) which is assumed to be a constant. It is 0.368 ±0.015 kg/MJ \nbased on field controlled experiments regardless of the land surface conditions (Wooster et al., \n2005). This coefficient has been accepted for the calculation of biomass burning emissions from \nMODIS FRP, SEVERI FRP and GOES FRP (Roberts et al., 2009; Ellicott et al., 2009, Zhang et \nal., 2012), and so this value will be adopted. \nF is emission factor (a representative value that is used to represent the quantity of a trace gas or \naerosol species released into the atmosphere during a forest fire activity. The value is a function of \nfuel type and is expressed as the number of kilograms of particulate per ton (or metric ton) of \nmaterial or fuel. The value for F will be assigned for each emitted species (CO and PM2.5) with \nland cover type according to values published in literature (Andreae and Merlet, 2001; Wiedinmyer \net al., 2006). Specifically, the emission factors will be assigned to stratified land cover types: e.g. \n11.07 g/kg (PM2.5) and 77 g/kg (CO) in forests, 5.6 g/kg (PM2.5) and 84 g/kg (CO) in shrublands, \n9.5 g/kg (PM2.5) and 90 g/kg (CO) in grasslands, and 5.7 g/kg (PM2.5) and 70 g/kg (CO) in \ncroplands. \nAlthough INSAT-3D/R satellites observe the surface every 15–30 min, observations of diurnal \nfires may, to a great extent, be obstructed by the impact factors including cloud cover, canopy \ncover, heavy fire smoke, heterogeneity of the surface, large pixel size and view angle of satellites, \nand weak energy release from fire pixels (Giglio et al., 2003; Prins and Menzel, 1992; Roberts et \nal., 2005; Zhang et al., 2011). Thus, missing FRP observations cause a great amount of gaps in the \nspatial and temporal distributions. As a result, FRE in a given time period and region is not able to \nbe directly integrated from satellite-observed FRP. To overcome these limitations, the diurnal \npatterns of FRP need to be reconstructed, which will be done by using a climatological value of \nFRP between t1 and t2 as exemplified in fig.1. Since, we will be giving products only over forests \ntherefore, different forest density classes and forest types will be considered for making efforts in \nsimulating diurnal FRP climatology. \n \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 29 \n \n \nFig.1. Climatological diurnal FRP (average data from 2002 to 2005) for various ecosystems in \nNorth America (Zhang et al., 2012) \n \nTo do this, we will adopt the approach that was originally developed to reconstruct diurnal pattern \nof fire size (Zhang and Kondragunta, 2008; Zhang et al., 2011). The climatological FRP will be \ncalculated for forest types and their density classes, separately. These FRP data in a half-hourly \ninterval will be smoothed using statistical fittings. The offset of shift is determined from the data \npairs of the detected FRP for the given fire pixel and the corresponding values in the climatological \ncurve using a least square method. Because fires in a pixel may not last for a very long time and \ninstantaneous fires are not continuously detected due to the impacts from cloud cover, smoke, low \nseverity fires releasing limited fire energy, and other factors (Zhang et al., 2011), the fire duration \nwill be determined by assuming that fire could be extended 2 hours prior and post instantaneous \nfire detections if the number of the fire detections within a day is more than three times for the \nsame pixel. Otherwise, fire occurrences are based on actual satellite detections. Finally, total FRE \nwill be computed which is the time integral of fire radiative power (FRP) and FRE has correlation \nbetween PM 2.5 concentrations and other emissions.   \n…………………………..(3) \nwhere ts is the start time of a fire event and te is the end time of the fire pixel. \nFor a given material one may assert that the total FRE of a fire is directly related to mass consumed \nby that material’s heat of combustion, which can then be related to PM 2.5 and other emissions \n(Kaufman et al., 1998; Wooster et al., 2003; Roberts et al., 2005).    \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 30 \n \nBecause the temporal resolution of INSAT-3D/3DR will range from 15 (together) to 30 min \n(alone), we will set a minimum time step as 30 min. This means that we will calculate FRE by \nassuming that a fire can last for at least a half hour if there is one FRP observation. The half-hourly \nFRE is binned to calculate hourly biomass burning emissions.  \nIn near-real-time monitoring of biomass burning emissions, we will use INSAT-3D/3DR fire \nproducts from MMDRPS. The diurnal pattern of FRP will then be simulated for the previous day \n(0300 UTC – 0230 UTC for INSAT-3D & 0315UTC to 0245UTC for INSAT-3DR) for estimating \nfire emissions. As a result, the BBEP will be produced with a latency of 1 day. Daily and monthly \nemissions can be given as the sum of hourly values for a given region and an ecosystem type, \nseparately.  \n2.3.2 Domain of operation \nThe domain of application will be kept to 10° - 45°N, 45° - 105°E (covering SAARC countries, \npresently operational Asia_Mer Sector) and only to forest regions.  \n2.3.3 Global scenario \nFRP approach is adapted by WF_ABBA in the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite \nStudies (CIMSS), University of Wisconsin [Prins et al., 1998; Weaver et al., 2004]. Particularly, \nthe WF_ABBA V65 detects instantaneous fires in subpixels using infrared bands around 3.9 and \n10.7 mm from a network of geostationary satellite instruments that include SEVIRI on board the \nMeteosat-9, and Imagers on board both GOES and MTSAT. It then derives instantaneous FRP \nfrom radiances in single MIR [Wooster et al., 2003]. Further, to minimize false fire detections, the \nWF_ABBA uses a temporal filter to exclude the fire pixels that are only detected once within the \npast 12 h [Schmidt and Prins, 2003]. The WF_ABBA V65 has been installed in NOAA OSDPD \n(the Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution) to operationally produce FRP from \ngeostationary satellites since late 2009 (http://satepsanone.nesdis.noaa.gov/pub/FIRE/forPo/). The \nNOAA fire product provides detailed information of WF_ABBA V65 fire detections.  \n2.4. Assumptions and Limitations \nSeveral assumptions have been made concerning performance estimates. Meteorological satellite \ninstruments are not inherently designed to be able to detect and characterize small sub-pixel hot \nspots. Therefore, performance of the algorithm will be sensitive to instrument noise and other \nanomalies.  First of all, the output from the equations is no better than the input Imager data.  The \ntechnique assumes well calibrated Channels that meet current specifications for NedT, co-\nregistration, diffraction, earth location, saturation, etc.  It also assumes that sub-pixel detector \nsaturations are flagged and available for application in near real time.  If this information is not \navailable, sub-pixel characterization is suspect for both saturated and non-saturated fire pixels. The \nalgorithm assumes that observed radiances are determined by the fire and non-fire portion of the \npixel and are only affected by and adjusted for surface emissivity, water vapor attenuation, semi-\ntransparent clouds/smoke, diffraction, and solar reflectivity (3.9 µm band – Channel 3 – only).  \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 31 \n \nEach of the above “attenuation” (except clouds/smoke) properties are assumed the same for the \nfire pixel and background conditions. \n2.5. \nValidation \nHigh uncertainty exists in global biomass emissions and accurate validation is currently not \npossible because of the lack of reliable in situ measurement. Therefore, BBEP will be compared \nwith other data sources. We will validate our product with the Global Fire Emissions Database \n(GFED), Quick Fire Emission Data (QFED), SEVIRI, Himawari & FY-4A and MODIS products. \nValidation using in-situ measurement using portable instruments will also be attempted. \n \nReferences  \nAndreae, M.

Introduction \nLand surface albedo, defined as the fraction of incident solar radiation (0.3–4.0 um) reflected by \nland surfaces (Dickinson, 1995; Liang, 2004) is one of the most important parameters in general  \ncirculation  models,  hydrology  models,  numerical  weather  models,  and  surface radiation-\nbudget studies. Land surface albedo (LSA) is a key geophysical parameter controlling the energy \nbudget in land–atmosphere interactions (Dickinson, 1983). LSA varies spatially and evolves \nseasonally based on solar illumination conditions, rainfall, soil moisture, vegetation growth, snow \naccumulation/melting and anthropogenic activities. Satellite remote sensing can provide a vantage \npoint for estimating land surface albedo at various spectral,  spatial,  temporal,  and  angular  \nresolutions.  During the last  few  decades, many satellite-generated albedo products have been \nderived with varying spatial resolution of 500 m to 20 km. Many researchers across the globe have \ndeveloped algorithms for various sensors to derive albedo directly from satellite observations. The \nAVHRR algorithm provides global  coverage  of  albedo  products  (Strugnell  &  Lucht,  2001).  \nPOLDER  and  MISR  allow researchers  to  use  multi-angular  information  to  obtain  a  better  \nunderstanding  of  surface reflectance  anisotropy  (Diner  et  al.,  1999;  Leroy  et  al.,  1997).  The  \nModerate  Resolution  Imaging  Spectroradiometer  (MODIS)  albedo  product  (Schaaf  et  al.,  \n2002)  utilizes  multiple spectral bands to derive accurate broadband albedo estimations at both \nhigh spatial and high temporal  resolutions.  Clouds  and  the  Earth’s  Radiant  Energy  System  \n(CERES)  uses  broad shortwave band to derive the planetary albedo (Rutan et al., 2006). With the \ndevelopment  and availability of geostationary satellite sensors, many researchers have focused on \nderiving the  diurnal  changes  of  surface  albedo  based  on  a  much  wider  range  of  solar  \nillumination angles, such as the Meteosat/SEVIRI albedo product (Geiger et al., 2008; Pinty et al., \n2000). \n \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 36 \n \n3.3. Theoretical background  \nThe conventional methods for estimating broadband albedos rely on a series of steps in the \nprocessing chain, including atmospheric correction, surface angular modelling, and narrowband-\nto-broadband albedo  conversions. Unfortunately, errors associated with each procedure  may  be  \naccumulated  and  significantly  impact  the  accuracy  of  the  final  albedo products (Liang, 2003). \nUncertainties associated with each procedure may be accumulate and may have bearing on final \noutput. \nAn alternative scheme developed in the earlier studies (Liang et al., 1999, 2003)  linked  TOA (top-\nof-atmosphere) narrowband albedos with three land surface broadband albedos using a \nfeedforward  neural  network  without  performing  any  atmospheric  corrections.  This  idea stems \nfrom earlier study (Pinker et al., 1985) that linearly related TOA and surface broadband albedos.  \nSurface  broadband  albedo  depends  on  surface  spectral  reflectance  as  well  as atmospheric \nconditions. TOA observations contain information on both surface reflectance and atmospheric \noptical properties, which implies that it is possible for us to compute the broadband  albedos  using  \nTOA  narrowband  albedos  without  performing  any  atmospheric corrections. \nLiang  et  al.  (1999)  used  the  MODTRAN  model  to  simulate  TOA  reflectances  under  the \nLambertian assumption, and they obtained a relationship between MODIS TOA reflectances and  \nbroadband  albedos  by  using  a  neural  network  method.  Liang  et  al.  (2003)  used  the projection  \npursuit  regression  method.  However,  these  two  studies  did  not  consider  the anisotropy of \nthe land surface. Liang et al. (2005) further improved it for estimating daily land surface albedo of \nthe Greenland ice sheet from MODIS data. They used the discrete ordinates radiative  transfer  \nprogram  for  a  multilayered  plane  parallel  medium  to  simulate  TOA reflectances  of  snow/ice  \nand  then  developed  the  relationship  between  bidirectional  TOA reflectances  and  broadband  \nalbedos  using  an  empirical  training  method;  they divided  the solar/view geometry space into \nangular bins and calculated the regression coefficients of each angular bin using a linear regression \nmethod. Qu et al. (2015) have provided detailed review of algorithms for albedo. \nHere,  we  propose  to  develop  a  direct-estimation  algorithm  by  employing  an  atmospheric \nradiative transfer code to simulate the TOA directional reflectances in the two spectral bands of \nINSAT-3D Imager located in visible (0.55-0.75 um) and shortwave infrared-  SWIR (1.55-1.70 \num) wavelengths and also calculate the broadband reflectance in the shortwave band (0.4-2.5  um),  \nand  then  establishing  a  relationship  between  the  TOA  reflectances  and  the broadband \nreflectance using the regression method, which would yield narrow to broadband conversion \ncoefficients. \nAn  approach  for  estimating  land  surface  broadband  albedo  from  multispectral  remote sensing  \nobservations  is  a  hybrid  approach  that  combines  extensive  radiative  transfer simulations \n(physical) with regression methods (statistical). It directly links the TOA radiance or reflectance \nto surface broadband albedo without performing different processes as per the first  approach.  Here  \nnarrowband-to-broadband  spectral  conversion  by  considering  the spectral response function of \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 37 \n \nthe sensor in various spectral bands of the instrument is the main  step  required  to  derive  the  \nalbedo.  Figure  1  shows  the  spectral  signatures  of  major surfaces with the relative spectral \nresponse (RSR) of INSAT-3D Imager instrument. A weighting factors  (Narrow  to  broad  band  \nconversion  coefficients)  are  to  be  determined  with  the radiative  transfer  simulations.  This  \napproach  has  been  successfully  used  to  estimate broadband albedo from MODIS data (Liang \net al., 2003). \n \n \nFigure 1. A typical spectral distribution of the reflectances for vegetation, soil, snow over shortwave solar \nspectrum range shown with the RSR of two spectral bands: visible (solid line) and SWIR (dashed line) of \nINSAT-3D Imager instrument. \n \n3.4. Methodology \nIn the present study, the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) is not taken into \nconsideration and the surface is assumed to reflect isotropically (i.e. equally at all angles), so this \nalbedo is referred to as the \"diffuse albedo\" or the \"hemispherical albedo\". When the land surface \nis assumed as lambertian (the reflectance is isotropic from different solar/view angles), the value \nof Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF) is then equal to the albedo and the  surface  broadband  \nalbedo  can  be  estimated  from  linear  combinations  of  narrowband albedo (spectral directional \nreflectance) with different weight coefficients. This method was first proposed by Brest and \nGoward (1987) and was then applied to different sensors: AVHRR (Saunders, 1990; Russell et al, \n1997), Landsat TM (Duguay & Ledrew, 1992; Knap et al, 1999), Meteosat (Valiente et al., 1995) \nand Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) (Liang, 2003). Liang (2001) reviewed the \nabove studies and provided simple conversion coefficients for  estimating  broadband  surface  \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 38 \n \nalbedo  from  a  variety  of  sensors  under  different atmospheric and surface conditions. The \nvalidation results show that the conversion formulae are very accurate with an average residual \nstandard error around 0.02 (Liang et al., 2003).  \n \nFigure 2. Algorithm flowchart for direct-retrieval of the broadband albedo from the INSAT-3D Imager \ndata by generating narrow to broadband conversion coefficients \nFor the retrieval of broadband albedo in the present study, the basic procedure consists of three \nmajor steps as illustrated in figure 2. The first step is to conduct extensive radiative transfer \nsimulations using the 6SV code, the second step is to obtain the narrow to broad band conversion \ncoefficients by linking the simulated TOA reflectance with surface broadband reflectance using \nlinear regression analysis and third step is to apply the narrow to broadband conversion coefficients \non the INSAT-3D Imager data to obtain the broadband albedo. Various surface  reflectance  spectra  \nof  different  cover  types  with  different  atmosphe ric  conditions have  been  incorporated  into  \nthe  radiative  transfer  simulations.  In  this  study,  attempt  has been made to estimate land surface \nbroadband albedos using TOA directional reflectance, instead of TOA spectral albedos. This \nimprovement has in fact greatly simplified this method, since calculating TOA spectral albedo \nrequires TOA angular modelling that might introduce large errors.    \n3.4.1.  Radiative transfer simulations \nFor  a  given  atmospheric  and  surface  condition,  we  need  to  compute  the  directional \nreflectance at the top of the atmosphere. Assuming the surface is Lambertian, the upw elling \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 39 \n \nradiance at the TOA can be computed by radiative transfer simulations through  6SV (Second \nSimulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum  –  Vector version)  code  (Vermote et al., \n1997). It is critical to use the representative surface reflectance spectra in data simulations. \nDifferent  surface  reflectance  spectra  covering the  spectral  range  0.4–2.5  um  representing \nvegetation, sand, water, snow surfaces were interpolated in the study. The simulation outputs \ninclude total shortwave albedo and spectral albedos that are calculated by incorporating the sensor \nspectral response functions. \nIn  the  6SV  simulations, varying aerosol optical  thickness  values  corresponding to  lower  to \nhigher aerosol loadings, continental aerosol model, and tropical atmospheric profile that also \nrepresent different water vapor and other gaseous amounts and profiles. The aerosol  model used \nare the defaults in 6SV and atmospheric profiles over Indian region were used in the simulations. \nFor the operational application of this method, more should perhaps be included to represent the \nvariable atmospheric conditions. The upwelling TOA radiance (L) is further normalized to \napparent spectral reflectance (a) using the expression, \n \nWhere,  d  is  the  Sun-Earth  distance  in  Astronomical  Units,  E0  is  exo-atmospheric  solar \nirradiance and  s is the sun  zenith angle. Land surface broadband albedo is defined as the ratio \nof the surface upwelling flux (Fu) to the downward flux (Fd) (Liang, 2003), \n \nwhere  is denoted to the waveband from wavelength 1 to wavelength 2 If \n albedo is the total shortwave broadband albedo.

One of the major limitations in this \nsimulation study is its assumption of Lambertian surfaces. The major reason is that we do not have \na good understanding of the directional reflectance properties of various  surface types at the \nINSAT-3D Imager resolution. \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 40 \n \n3.4.2.  Generation of narrow to broadband albedo conversion coefficients \nOnce the database is created from the simulations described above, the next step is to link TOA \nreflectance to land surface broadband albedos. This exercise is to be carried out for each of the \nmajor land cover types. We used regression analysis to establish the linear relationship (equation \n4) between TOA reflectance in two bands of INSAT-3D Imager and LSA and to obtain the arrow \nto broadband (NtoB) conversion coefficients C0, C1, and C2. \n \nWhere  is the broadband LSA, while  3D-VIS  and  3D-SWIR  are the TOA reflectances in \nvisible and  SWIR  bands  of  INSAT-3D  Imager  sensor  respectively.  A  set  of  NtoB  coefficients  \nare computed for four major land covers namely, soil, vegetation, water and snow. The physical \nmeaning of the conversion factors C1  and C2  is obvious from equation (4). They quantify the ratio \nof the reflected radiances within the narrow bands to the reflected radiances for the visible and \nSWIR broad bands, or the degree of the representativeness of the narrowband reflectance for  the  \nbroadband  reflectance.  The conversion  coefficients  developed  from extensive radiative transfer \nsimulations are then would be applied to the INSAT-3D Imager TOA reflectance data. \n3.4.3.  Calibration of the TOA observations of INSAT-3D Imager sensor \nIt  has  been  observed  that  the  satellite-level  signal  in  two  spectral  bands  of  the  INSAT-3D \nImager instrument significantly underestimate the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance values. This  \nfactor  severely  modulates  the  LSA  computations.  An  exercise  was  carried  out  to compensate  \nthis  factor  of  underestimation  from  a  systematic  comparison  between  TOA radiances of \nINSAT-3D Imager and INSAT-3A CCD and MODIS  sensors.  After introducing the radiance \ncalibration coefficients equation (4) can be rewritten as, \n \nWhere  1  and  2  are  radiance  calibration  coefficients  of  INSAT-3D  Imager  instrument.  \nAssuming the multiplication of two coefficients 1 and C1  as new coefficient  1,  2 and C2 as \n2 and C0 as 0, equation (5) can be rewritten as, \n \n3.4.4.  Data used and generation of LSA \nRaw digital number data of visible and SWIR bands of INSAT-3D Imager sensor corresponding \nto 10:30 hrs of 1st of each month of year 2015 was downloaded from the MOSDAC server. The \ndigital number data were converted to the TOA radiances, which was subsequently converted to \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 41 \n \nthe TOA reflectances using equation (1). A cloud mask was devised from two sources, (a) \nthresholds of INSAT-3D Imager data and (b) MODIS cloud mask. A cloud-free TOA reflectance  \ndata was then converted to the LSA using the N to B coefficients generated from the simulation \nexercise as discussed in previous section. A land over product available from the MODIS sensor \nwas used as a reference for applying land cover-based N to B coefficients. \n3.5. Results \nMonthly broadband LSA maps were derived from the INSAT-3D Imager data representing 1st day \nof each month of the year 2015 using the method discussed in the above section.  The broadband \nLSA was derived at a spatial resolution of 4 km over India and surrounding region. The broadband \nLSA maps for different months are shown in the figure 3.  Visually the spatial patterns and \nmagnitudes of broadband albedo look very reasonable.  Majority of the broadband albedo values \nare in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 representing vegetation and soil pixels. However, desert regions show \nLSA value greater than 0.3 and ranged between 0.3 to 0.5. While snow covered regions show LSA \nvalue greater than 0.4 or 0.5. An error due to clouds still persists even though the cloud mask was \napplied on the images. Fringe of clouds are seen with very high albedo values, which causes an \nerroneous albedo value. A better mechanism for removing clouds has to be developed in future. \nThe  assumption  of  a  Lambertian  surface  is  being  debated  (Liang  et  al.,  2003).  The  key \nargument is  that the broadband albedo depends on  both spectral and angular properties of the land \nsurface. From the validation analysis of the study  by Liang et al. (2003), it appeared that an \nassumption of spectral information  dominance over the angular information does not lead to \nsignificant  errors, which is an important achievement of this study.  Overall it can  be said that \nbroadband LSA could be successfully computed over India from the INSAT-3D Imager \nobservations. \nThis is a preliminary study carried out for computing the broadband land surface albedo from the \nINSAT-3D Imager sensor, however detailed study is underway to establish the proposed method  \nwith  more  simulations  involving  additional  land  cover  types.  There  is  also  a requirement to \nenhance the cloud removal technique, which will minimize the noise observed in  the  albedo  \nretrieval.  Moreover,  issue  related  to  the  calibration  of  INSAT -3D  Imager radiance has to be \nrectified for robust retrieval of the broadband albedo. \n \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 42 \n \n \nFigure 3.

Summary and Future scope \nIn  this  document,  we  have  presented  the  algorithm  theoretical basis  (Version  1.0)  for the \nbroadband  land  surface  albedo  from  INSAT-3D  Imager  dataset.  The  technique  involves \ndevelopment of a direct-estimation of broadband land surface albedo from the observations of the \nINSAT-3D Imager sensor, which is available from the geostationary platform. Extensive \ntheoretical modelling study was carried out,  where an atmospheric radiative transfer model was \nused to simulate the TOA signals in two broad bands of Imager sensor  for diverse land atmospheric \nscenario. After the simulation exercise was over, a relationship between TOA reflectances and \nland-surface broadband albedos was developed from the simulation results, which  provided  a  set  \nof  conversion  coefficients.  A  separate  set  of  narrow  to  broadband conversion coefficients for \neach of the major land covers was generated for INSAT-3D Imager data. Using the proposed \nmethod broadband land surface albedo maps were generated over India  from  the  TOA  \nobservations  of  INSAT-3D  Imager  sensor.  Validation  of  the  retrieved albedo will be carried \nout by comparing it with MODIS albedo products and  in-situ  albedo measurements.

Bhattacharya \nEvapotranspiration \nbaseline \ndocument \n \n4.2. Introduction \nEvapotranspiration (ET) is one of the key variables in hydrological cycle, agricultural drought and \ncrop yield deviation. It is a term used to describe the combined loss of water due to the evaporation \nlargely from soil surface and transpiration from plants.  ET is a central process in the climate \nsystem and a nexus of water, energy & carbon cycle (Jung et.al. 2010). Land evapotranspiration \n(ET) is an essential component in global water, energy and carbon cycles, and provides a link \nbetween the atmosphere and the Earth’s surface (Betts et al., 1996; Jiménez et al., 2011; Tang et \nal., 2014; Zhang et al., 2012, 2015). It is also an important indicator of hydrologic and heat \nvariations under a changing climate and anthropogenic interference (Brutsaert and Parlange, 1998; \nOhmura and Wild, 2002; Wang and Dickinson, 2012). Accurate quantification of ET is thus critical \nfor understanding the hydro-climatologic processes and the interactions of the Earth system \n(Rodell and Famiglietti, 2002). However, the estimation of large-scale ET from ground-based \nmeasurements alone remains challenging due to the sparse network of point observations and the \nhigh spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability of ET (Xu and Singh, 2005; Xue et al., 2013). \nTo address this limitation, a number of global ET products have been derived in recent years, \nincluding remote sensing-based products (Su, 2002; Muet al., 2007, 2011; Zhang et al., 2009, 2010; \nMiralles et al., 2011b; Yang et al., 2013).         There are many methods mentioned in the literature \nsuch as SEBAL (Bastiaanssen 2013), TSEB (Norman & Becker, 1995) and SEBS (Su, 2002). Most \nof the model uses the operationally available polar/ near-polar orbit satellite datasets such as \nMODIS, ASTER, LANDSAT have long been utilized for the estimation of ET from field to \nregional scale. However, the output records suffer from spatial and temporal gaps due to cloud \ncover and in-frequent image availability based on satellite overpass schedule. However, \ngeostationary satellites, have high temporal resolution continuously measuring several factors \nrelated to land surface and the atmosphere over large regional scales. Thus, they have high potential \nin calculating land surface and water cycle at hourly temporal resolution.  This shows the vital role \nof geostationary satellite in modelling Evapotranspiration on spatial scale. Operational ET \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 47 \n \nproducts are available over US and Europe using thermal remote sensing data from geostationary \nmeteorological satellite data such as GOES (Anderson et al, 2007) and MSG-SEVIRI (Hu et al, \n2015). \n4.2.1. Overview and background \nMost of the methods used for modelling evapotranspiration uses energy surface balance framework \nusing thermal infrared remote sensing.  This describes the heat and water transfer from land surface \nto overlying atmosphere within surface layer of Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) : \nRn- G = H + λE                (1) \nWhere, Rn is the net surface radiation, G is the soil heat flux, H is the sensible heat flux and λE is \nthe latent heat flux. Remote sensing technique can provide spatial and temporal information of \nNormalized Difference Vegetation  Index (NDVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), surface  albedo, surface \nemissivity, and radiometric surface temperature, most of which are indispensable to the models \nand methods that partition the available  energy (Li et. al. 2009 , Mauser et.al. 1998).  A large \nnumber of efforts  have been made to incorporate remotely sensed  surface temperature in \ncombination  with other critical variables,  e.g., NDVI and albedo into ET modeling  during the \npast three decades (kala et.al. 2008). It was Penman (Penman 1948) who laid the foundation for \nrelating evapotranspiration to meteorological variables (Allen et.al. 1998). Model simulations or \nempirical equations requiring meteorological data are the traditional way of estimating \nevapotranspiration such as gradient method, Bowen ratio method, eddy covariance method, \nlysimeter method.  Malamos et.al. (2015) used PM method to estimate ET on the field scale level \nwhile Uddin et.al. (2013) used the Bowen ratio method & EC method to estimate latent heat fluxes.   \nHowever, because of some practical reasons like diversity in land covers or temporal changes in \nthe landscape, these methods may not represent the evapotranspiration at regional-scale effectively \n(Zhang et.al. 1995) The most frequently used method  for estimating evapotranspiration at present \nis the Penman-Monteith equation.   The energy balance concept and net radiation are used as the \nprincipal parameters in most of the remote sensing methods for estimating evapotranspiration (Li \net.al. 2002). Till date, several energy balance algorithms are available for calculating ET through \nremote sensing. such as SEBAL (Bastiaanssen et.al.1998) and SEBS (Su,2002). They are single \nsource model which consider soil and plant as single source. In addition to these, there are dual-\nsource or two-source (soil and vegetation canopy) models, e.g. TSEB (Norman & Becker 1995), \nSEBI (Menenti & Choudhury 1993) and ALEXI (Anderson, Norman, Diak, kustas & Mecikalski, \n1997). Therefore, considering the characteristics and significance of the various ET methods \ndeveloped over the past decades, precise estimation of ET over regional scale based on the remote \nsensing technology has become a critical question in ET related studies. \n \n \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 48 \n \n4.2.2. Objectives \nThe objectives of this document are: \n(i) \nTo outline the algorithm for the estimation of day-time and daily Evapotranspiration \n(ET) over land in all-sky conditions \n(ii) \nTo implement the algorithm in IMDPS GPR (Geophysical Parameter Retrieval) chain \nfor automation of ET product generation \n(iii) \nTo describe validation strategy against available in-situ measurements and other \navailable satellite-based and reanalysis products. \n4.2.3.    Instrument and characteristics of input products \n4.2.3.1. Indian geostationary satellite INSAT 3DR  \nThe Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system is a joint venture of the Department of Space (DOS), \nDepartment of Telecommunications (DOT), and India Meteorological Department (IMD). INSAT-\n3DR carries a multi-spectral Imager (optical radiometer) capable of generating the images of the \nearth in six wavelength bands significant for meteorological observations, namely, visible (0.55-\n0.75 µm), shortwave infrared (1.55-1.68 µm), middle infrared (3.8-4.1 µm), water vapor (6.5-7.1 \nµm) and two bands in thermal infrared (10.3-11.3 µm & 11.5-12.5 µm) regions. It also has 19 \nchannel sounder, which is the first such payload to be flown on an ISRO satellite mission. The \nspatial resolution is 1 km x 1 km for VIS/SWIR band and 4 km x 4 km for thermal IR and 8 km X \n8 km bands. The introduction of INSAT Meteorological Data Processing System (IMDPS) (2014) \nprovides both ‘full-globe’ and ‘sector’ data products in all the six bands of imager at half-an-hour \ninterval at 4 km spatial resolution in an automated mode. So, there are maximum 48 acquisitions \non a given day. Raw data after reception at each acquisition were corrected for servo, line loss, \nradiometry, stagger and oversampling removal using the INSAT 3D/3DR data products scheduler. \nThis results into automated generation of co-registered data in each band at Transverse Mercator \n(TM) projection.  The dimension of each band at each acquisition is 1617 rows x 1615 columns \nfor Asia Mercator sector product.  \n4.2.3.2. Required inputs \nOperational all-sky hourly Net radiation product, sliding monthly noon-time composite of land \nsurface albedo, instantaneous LST from INSAT 3DR \nThe proposed algorithm for ET will use the INSAT Net radiation hourly product in the MMDRPS \noperational chain. The net radiation will be computed from daily insolation product at 4 km from \nINSAT 3D/3DR, proposed operational albedo product from INSAT 3D/3DR, hourly forecast air \ntemperature and relative humidity from WRF model, land surface temperature (LST) from INSAT \n3D/3DR, using the surface emissivity obtained from 10 year historical MODIS database or real-\ntime composite NDVI at 1-4 km from other sources (https://www.eumetsat.int/website/home/ \nSatellites/CurrentSatellites/Meteosat) for SEVIRI NDVI product for Indian ocean coverage, \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 49 \n \nNational Data Centre, NRSC, Hyderabad for OCM-2 & AWiFS NDVI). The net radiation needs to \nbe made operationally available under clear and cloudy sky conditions to generate latent heat flux \nand Evapotranspiration (ET).  \n4.2.3.3. Hourly short-range forecast from WRF  \nWeather Research and Forecasting (WRF; Skamarock et al., 2008) Model version 3.1 is used for \nAll India Short range weather forecast. WRF is a limited area, non-hydrostatic, primitive equation \nmodel with multiple options for various physical parameterization schemes. The WRF Model is \nintegrated in a triple domain configuration with a horizontal resolution of 45 km, 15 km and 5 km \nfor the All India, with grid points 260×235, 352×373 and 676×721 in x and y directions for the \ndomains 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The model has 36 vertical levels with the top of the model \natmosphere located at 10 hPa. The WRF 3D-Var is used for the assimilation of all available \nconventional including ISRO-AWS data and satellite observations to improve the model initial \nconditions. The operational WRF short-range forecasts (Kumar et al., 2011), available at \nMOSDAC site used climatological land surface and atmospheric parameters from global database \nand assimilated all available conventional including ISRO-AWS. The operational forecast is \navailable at finer spatial resolution (~ 5km) at hourly intervals up to 72 hours. Similarly, IMD is \nalso running a WRF model in a double domain configuration with a horizontal resolution of 9 km \nand 3 km for the RSMC Domain and All India domain respectively. The model has 46 vertical \nlevels with the top of the model atmosphere located at 50 hPa. In this algorithm only temperature \nand relative humidity at 2-meter height from surface will be used for estimation of ET. For testing \nthe prototype algorithm, SAC WRF forecasts at 5km resolution will be used. However, for \noperational implementation in MMDRPS, IMD WRF forecasts will be used.  \n4.3. Inputs \n4.3.1.

Algorithm functional specifications \n4.4.1. Clear sky Latent heat flux (λE clr) \nThe Latent heat flux is computed using the equation (2) given by PM equation (Monteith, 1965) \nλEclr = \n\u0005ɸ\u0007 \t \n\u000b\f\r\u000e\u000f\n\u0010\u0007ϒ (\u0003\u0007 \u0012\r \n\u0012\u0013 )  ……(2) \nHere, ɸ is net available energy (Rn- G) , λEclr is  clear sky latent heat flux or evapotranspiration ( \nWm-2) , s is slope of SVP vs. temperature curve, ρ is air density( kg m-3), γ  is psychometric \nconstant(hPa K-1) , cp is specific heat of air (MJ kg-1 K-1), DA is vapor pressure deficit, gB is \nboundary layer conductance ( ms-1), gS is stomatal (or surface) conductance(ms-1) \nThe method used here to compute latent heat flux combines satellite TS data (LST) obtained from \nINSAT 3DR with standard energy balance closure models in order to derive a hybrid closure that \ndoes not require the specification of surface to atmosphere conductance terms (Mallick et.al. 2014). \nThis method is referred to as the Surface Temperature Initiated Closure (STIC). This method can \nbe used by simultaneously solving four state equations as mentioned by (Mallick et.al. 2014) to \nestimate latent heat flux. The four internal state equations needs to be solved in iterative manner \nto compute LE are given below: \nɅ =  \n\u0004\u0015\u0005\n\u0004\u0005\u0007 Ƴ(\u0004\u0007 \u0012\r\n\u0012\u0013)                      (3) \n∆T = \n\u0017\u0013\u0018 \u0017\u000f \nƳ\n (\n\u0003\u0018Ʌ\nɅ )                 (4) \ngs = gB \n\u0017\u0013\n∗\u0018 \u0017\u000f\n\u0017\u0013\u0018\u0017\u000f\n                         (5) \ngB = \n\u001b \nƍ \u001d\u001e(∆ \u0007 \n!\"#!$ \nƳ\n)           (6) \nHere Ʌ is the evaporative fraction, ∆T is expressed as Ts-Ta where Ta (oC) is the air temperature \nand Ts is land surface temperature (oC). e& is effective vapour pressure (hPa), e' is atmospheric \nvapour pressure (hPa) at Ta height of measurement and (\u0010\n∗ is saturation vapour pressure at Ts.  The \nblock diagram to compute LE from iterative solution is shown below. In the flow chart (Figure 1), \nTSD is the surface dew point temperature (0C), M is moisture availability at surface (0-1) TD is dew \npoint temperature (0C). \nThe input needed for computation of λE mentioned in equation (2) are air temperature (Ta), LST \n(Ts), Relative humidity (RH), Net radiation (Rn) and soil heat flux (G), For clear sky conditions, \nhourly Net radiation (Rn) product will be used as input. Air temperature and relative humidity will \nbe taken from WRF model at 2m height on hourly scale. LST obtained from INSAT 3DR will be \nused on-hourly scale as input to this model.  \nIn order to solve net surface available energy, ɸ  (=Rn –G) as mentioned in equation (2) and (6) \nwe need to obtain soil heat flux. The soil heat flux can be obtained by two approaches: \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 52 \n \n \n \nFigure 1: Diagrammatic representation of the core equations used to recover the internal state \nvariables in STIC (Mallick et.al. 2014) \n4.4.2. Soil heat flux model \nStatitsical approach    \nThe ratio of daytime soil heat flux and net radiation from AMS measurements over short vegetative \nsystems were found to produce logarithmic relation with INSAT 3A CCD NDVI at 1 km. This \nrelation was used to derive the soil heat flux (Bhattacharya et. al . 2014). \n \nFigure 2: Relationship of net radiation fraction of soil heat flux (G) with NDVI \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 53 \n \nIt resulted into a significant correlation coefficient of 0.8. The spread is relatively more which \ncould be due to difference in situ measurement footprints of soil heat flux and net radiation, and \nINSAT 3A CCD. This function was used to estimate soil heat flux through inversion from regional \ndaytime net radiation and INSAT NDVI. \nThis relation G = -12.5 ln(NDVI)-1.317 will be used to compute the G/Rn ratio. Using all-sky net \nradiation product from INSAT 3DR and sliding monthly NDVI composite from other sources, \ndaytime G and net available energy can be computed. Since nighttime soil heat flux is very \nnegligible, daytime   G will be scaled to daily 24 hours average G to derive daily ɸ.  \n \nThermal inertia-based (TI) physical modelling approach \nThe physical model for the land surface soil heat flux estimate based on the harmonic \nanalysis of soil surface temperature (HM model) is described by Murray and Verhoef et.al. (2007) \nas follows: \n                   G = Γ *( ( 1 - \n)\n*  +, )* (∑\n./√/ώ \n1\n)\n sin(nώt + ɸn + \n2\n3 − \n2Δ5\n)*  )) = Γ * Js      (7) \nwhere G (W m−2) is the at-surface soil heat flux, Γ (J m−2 K−1 s−0.5) is the soil thermal inertia, M is \nthe total number of harmonics used  An is the amplitude of the n’th soil surface temperature (Ts) \nharmonic, ω (rad s−1) is the angular frequency, t is the time (s), ϕn (rad) is the phase shift of the \nn’th soil surface temperature harmonic, and Js is the summation of harmonic terms of soil surface \ntemperature.   \nThe parameter soil thermal inertia, Γ, is a key variable for estimating G0 using Eq. (10). \nMurray and Verhoef adopted the concept of normalized thermal conductivity (O. Johansen 1977)  \nand developed a physical method to calculate Γ as \nτ = exp [ϒ (1- Srϒ-δ)] (τ* - τ0) + τ0                                                       (8) \nwhere Γ and Γ0 are the thermal inertia for saturated and air-dry soil (J m−2 K−1 s−0.5) respectively. \nAlso    τ0 = -1062.4 Ө* + 1010.8 & τ* = 788.2 (Ө*-1.29).   θ (cm3 cm−3) as soil porosity (equal to \nthe saturated soil moisture content); γ (−) is a parameter depending on soil texture obtained from \nsoil map ; Sr is the mositue availability at surface obtained moisture availability subroutine from \nSTIC model. For instantaneous observations using satellite data n =1 and phase ɸ can be taken as \n00.     \n                                  Js (t) = ( 1 - \n)\n*  +, )* (./√/ώ 789 :9ώ; +  ɸ9 + \n2\n3 − \n2=5\n)*  >       (9) \nΔt (s) is time offset between the canopy composite temperature and the below-canopy soil surface \ntemperature and is found as 1.5 h in Murray and Verhoef based on their data. With the two boundary \nvalues (i.e., Δt =1.5 h for fc=1 and Δt=0h for fc=0), a linear approach is proposed here to describe \ntime offset Δt as function of vegetation fraction (fc). NDVI data from OCM, MSG-SEVRI or \nMODIS will be used to compute fc \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 54 \n \n                Δt= 1.5 · fc                                                                                  (10) \nOnce the soil heat flux is obtained then ɸ  is solved if all clear-sky instances prevail throughout \nthe day.  \n7.4.3 Cloudy sky Latent heat flux (λE cld) \nThe latent heat flux under cloudy sky conditions can be estimated using equation (2). Under cloudy \nsky conditions LST is not available, so the challenge is to retrieve LST under cloudy-sky condtions \nthrough inverse modelling. \n4.5.  LST retrieval under cloudy-sky \nFrom the proposed net radiation product, the all-sky net radiation data are pre-requisite for LST \nrecovery under cloudy-sky conditions. The net surface longwave radiation will be obtained as a \ndifference from net surface radiation and net surface shortwave radiation under cloudy sky \nconditions.  Net surface shortwave radiation will be obtained from instantaneous surface insolation \nproduct and noon-time sliding monthly albedo composite. The incoming longwave radiation will \nbe deducted using WRF forecast data to retain outgoing longwave radiation (Rlocld). By inverting \nthe equation of stefan-boltzmann law we can recover LST. \nLSTcloud = (Rlocld /(Ɛs σ))1/4   (11) \nHere under cloudy sky conditions the 30-day composite value of surface emissivity for cloudy \npixel from  from historical MODIS data or sliding monthly NDVI composite will be used.   \nIf the LST is recovered then by using equation 2, we can obtain latent heat flux under cloudy \nconditions. (LEcld) \nIn this case also, like clear sky conditions for solving ɸ  (Rn –G) as mentioned in equation (2) & \n(6) we need to obtain soil heat flux. If LST is recovered under cloudy sky conditions the soil heat \nflux can be obtained by using TI- based model as discussed above. Here, in case of cloudy \nconditions for vegetation fraction (fc) we will use sliding monthly NDVI composite value cloudy \npixel from external sources. By using equations 7-10 soil heat flux (G) will be computed.  \nOnce ‘G’ is obtained using method mentioned in figure (3) cloudy sky Latent heat flux   (λE cld) \n4.5.1. Daily Evapotranspiration (ET) \nThe hourly latent heat flux (W m-2) will be converted in hourly ET (mm) using expression : \nλE (mm depth of water per hour ) = (λE (Wm-2) * 0.0015)    (12) \nThis hourly ET will be summed to obtained daily and day time evapotranspiration in mm depth of \nwater loss per day.  \n4.5.2.

Sensitivity analysis of STIC model simulated latent heat flux on LST \nand Albedo  \nThe accuracy of STIC model heavily depends on the quality of land surface temperature data due \nto its role in retrieving TSD and M. One-dimensional sensitivity analysis was  carried out to quantify \nthe impacts of uncertainty in TS and albedo on λE. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by \nincreasing and decreasing LST systematically from its original value while keeping the other \nvariables and parameters constant. This procedure was selected because the fluxes and other \nintermediate outputs of STIC model reflect an integrated effect of change in LST. Firstly, surface \nfluxes (λE) were computed using the original LST data obtained from EC tower observations. Then \nLST was increased and decreased at constant interval and a new set of fluxes were computed. It \nwas found that λE was sensitive to the LST uncertainties with a magnitude of error ranging 2-12 \n% for LST error in the range of 0.5 - 3K.  \n \n \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 58 \n \nTable 4 : Sensitivity analysis of λE on LST \n \n \nTable 5.

Introduction \nMonitoring of the earth’s radiation budget is essential for improving our understanding of the \nearth’s climate and is changes since the radiative energy exchanges at the top of the atmosphere \n(TOA) and at the earth’s surface regulate the redistribution of energy and determine the energy \nbalance of the earth-atmosphere system. Rather than examining radiation budget as a whole, it is \nvery important to quantify its components, namely incoming and outgoing shortwave and \nlongwave radiation, within the atmosphere, and at the surface. Radiation budget and its different \ncomponents also listed in essential climatic variables of the emerging Global Framework for \nClimate Services (BojinSki et al., 2014). Net surface radiation (Rn) is a key parameter for energy \nand mass exchange between land and atmosphere and also play a vital role in many biological \nprocesses (Anderson et al. 2007). Radiative energy is the driving force for land surface \nmeteorological and micrometeorological processes, such as sensible and latent heat \n(evapotranspiration) transfer. The surface radiation balance is one of the major factors that \ndetermine the surface temperature of the vegetation canopy and the underlying soil substrate. Thus, \naccurate estimates of Rn are essential for understanding the land surface energy distribution, the \nformation and transformation of air masses, snow melting calculations (Male and Granger, 1981), \nmodeling crop transpiration and evapotranspiration, and addressing water resource management \n(Bisht and Bras, 2011). Rn (coupled with other energy balance component such as ground heat \nflux) serves as a key driving force for the evapotranspiration (ET). Estimation of Rn is necessary \nbecause it is a key input for land surface process and hydrological models, and are also used \nroutinely to calculate evapotranspiration (Monteith, 1965; Kustas & Norman,1997), which is a \ncritical component of agricultural, hydrological, and ecological research. Over the years, various \nET and land surface models have been developed that use remote sensing and ancillary surface \nand ground-based observations (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998). All ET models require estimates of Rn \nat spatial scale. Mallick et al (2009) and Westerhoff (2015) were observed sensitivity of Rn from \n10 to 40% for ET over different agro-ecosystems.   \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 65 \n \n5.2.1. Overview and background \nRn is the difference between the incoming and outgoing shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes \nat the surface. Mathematically described as: \nnl\nns\nn\nR\nR\nR\n\n\n                        (a) \nsi\nso\nsi\nns\nR\nR\nR\nR\n)\n1(\n\n\n\n\n\n     (b) \nlo\nli\nnl\nR\nR\nR\n\n\n                        (c)  \nwhere Rsi is the incoming shortwave radiation (Wm−2), Rso is the reflected outgoing shortwave \nradiation (Wm−2), which is calculated by Rso = α × Rsi, α is the shortwave broadband albedo \n(dimensionless), thus Rns is the net shortwave radiation, Rli is the incoming longwave radiation \n(Wm−2), Rlo is the outgoing longwave radiation (Wm−2), and Rnl is the net longwave radiation \n(Wm−2). Rn is normally positive during the daytime because net shortwave radiation dominates, \nbut negative during the nighttime because net longwave radiation dominates (Allen et al., 1998). \nIf all four components of Eq. (a) are known, the calculation of Rn is straightforward. Indeed, many \nradiation measurement towers measure these four components of radiation, thereby allowing us to \ndetermine Rn a given instance and location. Various satellite observations have been used to \ngenerate radiation products at regional and global scales (Liang et al., 2010, 2013b; Zhang et al., \n2014). MeteoSat Second Generation Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (MSG \nSEVIRI) Satellite observations from the visible to near-infrared spectrum have been used for \nestimating incident solar radiation and surface albedo, and thermal-infrared data for estimating \nlongwave radiation. To map the Rn, it is necessary to combine remote sensing observations with \nsurface and atmospheric data, where the spatial variability is mainly modeled by means of albedo, \nemissivity, and land surface temperature maps obtained from satellite data.  There are roughly two \ntypes of algorithms for estimating Rn (Liang et al., 2010), one calculates radiative quantities from \nthe derived satellite products of all relevant atmospheric and surface variables (e.g., cloud, \natmospheric temperature, LST, air and surface emissivity), and another estimates radiation directly \nfrom satellite observed radiance using a regression equation established from extensive radiative \ntransfer simulations or using ground measurements.  \n5.2.2. Objectives \nThe objectives of this document are: \n(iv) \nTo outline the algorithm for the estimation of hourly (Rn) and daily net surface radiation \n(Rndly) over land in clear and cloudy sky \n(v) \nTo implement the algorithm in IMDPS GPR (Geophysical Parameter Retrieval) chain \nfor automation of Rn and Rndly product generation \n(vi) \nTo describe validation strategy against available in-situ measurements amd other \nconcurrent satellite products. \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 66 \n \n5.2.3.   Instrument and characteristics of input products \n5.2.3.1 Indian geostationary satellite INSAT 3DR  \nThe Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system is a joint venture of the Department of Space (DOS), \nDepartment of Telecommunications (DOT), and India Meteorological Department (IMD). INSAT-\n3DR carries a multi-spectral Imager (optical radiometer) capable of generating the images of the \nearth in six wavelength bands significant for meteorological observations, namely, visible (0.55-\n0.75 µm), shortwave infrared (1.55-1.68 µm), middle infrared (3.8-4.1 µm), water vapor (6.5-7.1 \nµm) and two bands in thermal infrared (10.3-11.3 µm & 11.5-12.5 µm) regions. It also has 19 \nchannel sounder, which is the first such payload to be flown on an ISRO satellite mission. The \nspatial resolution of VIS band is 1 km x 1 km and 4 km x 4 km for WV and thermal IR bands. The \nintroduction of INSAT Meteorological Data Processing System (IMDPS) provides (Bhattacharya \net al. 2013) both ‘full-globe’ and ‘sector’ data products in all the six bands of imager at half-an-\nhour interval at 4 km spatial resolution in an automated mode. So, there are maximum 48 \nacquisitions on a given day. Raw data after reception at each acquisition were corrected for servo, \nline loss, radiometry, stagger and oversampling removal using the INSAT 3DR data products \nscheduler. This results into automated generation of co-registered data in each band at Transverse \nMercator (TM) projection.  The dimension of each band at each acquisition is 1617 rows x 1615 \ncolumns for Asia Mercator sector product.  \n5.2.3.2 Operational surface insolation product \nA spectrally integrated clear-sky and three-layer cloudy-sky models were developed to determine \nintegrated atmospheric transmittances and instantaneous insolation. Half-an-hourly observations \nfrom an Indian geostationary satellite sensor, INSAT 3DR will be used to provide minimum ground \nbrightness (surrogate of surface albedo) from previous 30 days, cloud top albedo, brightness \ntemperatures, atmospheric water vapour as inputs to these models in addition to global eight-day \naerosol optical depth at 550 nm and columnar ozone. A trapezoidal scheme will be implemented \nto obtain daily insolation (in MJm-2) from half-an-hour instantaneous insolation (Wm-2) throughout \nthe day for all-sky conditions (clear + cloudy).

Operational product of WRF short-range forecast \nWeather Research and Forecasting (WRF; Skamarock et al., 2008) Model version 3.1 is used for \nAll India Short range weather forecast. WRF is a limited area, non-hydrostatic, primitive equation \nmodel with multiple options for various physical parameterization schemes.  \nThe WRF Model is integrated in a triple domain configuration with a horizontal resolution of 45 \nkm, 15 km and 5 km for the All India, with grid points 260×235, 352×373 and 676×721 in x and \ny directions for the domains 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The model has 36 vertical levels with the top \nof the model atmosphere located at 10 hPa.

Introduction \nThe shortwave radiative flux absorbed by the ocean surface plays an important role in the \natmospheric and oceanic circulation through air-sea interaction particularly over the warm pool \nregion of the Indian Ocean [Lukas, 1989]. The accurate information of surface Short Wave \nRadiation (SWR) would also result in significantly improved representation of the intra-annual \noceanic surface processes and long term surface variability. The diurnal variations in the Sea \nSurface Temperature (SST) are driven by the surface solar radiation that is modulated primarily by \nthe presence of cloudiness. The SWR data available through buoys have sparse coverage due to the \nlarge cost and maintenance involved. In the recent years there have been efforts to establish an \naccurate estimate of the surface shortwave radiation budget (SRB) over Tropical Ocean and to \nassess its impact on the climate change.  \nThe tropical oceans with SST usually greater than 28 °C, forms a major part of the largest warm \npool on the earth. The variations of surface insolation over these warm pool regions are primarily \ndue to the variations in cloudiness which are manifestation of deep convection [Shinoda et al., \n1998; Sengupta et al., 2001]. The long-term surface measurements of radiative fluxes are limited \nprimarily to the continental regions [Ohmura and Gilgen, 1991]. The satellite estimates of \ncloudiness and top of the atmosphere fluxes have been used in conjunction with radiative transfer \nmodels to produce global estimates of SRB over land and ocean [Li, 1995; Rossow and Zhang, \n1995; Whitlock et al., 1995; Gupta et al., 1997]. The most popular algorithms used in computing \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 78 \n \nSRB estimates from satellite data are described by Pinker and Laszlo [1992] and Darnell et al. \n[1992].  \nThe global Analysis, such as the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) [Kalnay et \nal., 1996], National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Data Assimilation Office (NASA/DAO) \n[Schubert et al., 1993], and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis \n[ERA, 1999] projects have provided climate researchers with alternative estimates of the earth’s \nSRB. Bony et al. [1997] used data from the NASA/DAO and NCEP reanalysis for the period 1987–\n88 to compare SWR at the surface to satellite estimates in the Tropics (30°S–30°N). They found \nthe annual mean bias in NCEP SWR over the tropical ocean ranging from -10 to -30 W m-2, while \nNASA/DAO SWR biases ranged from -50 W m-2 in subsidence regions of the subtropics to -25 W \nm-2 in convective regions near the equator.  \nTable-1 provides a summary of presently available SWR products from different source alongwith \ntheir merits and demerits.   \nNote: LY products largely known as Large and Yeager product follows the earlier approach of Large and Nurser [2001], \nin which the NCEP surface radiation and precipitation are replaced by satellite-based estimates. \nThe present Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document describes a methodology to estimate SWR \nfrom half-hourly estimates of Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) obtained from Kalpana \nobservations.  Although we have shown the results with Kalpana derived OLR, but the same \nalgorithm has been tested with the data from other Indian GEO satellites.   \nSparse observations\nAccurate\nhourly\nBuoy Observations\n~10 km/\nDaily\n1°/ \nDaily\n1°/ \n3-hourly\n280 km/\n3-hourly\n1-2°/\n6-hourly\nSpatial/\nTemporal \nRes.\nComputationally expensive\n(Non-availability in real time)\nGlobal Product\nGEWEX\n(Satellite data + RT models)\nComputationally expensive\n(Non-availability in real time)\nGlobal Product\nISCCP\n(Satellite data + RT models)\nComputationally expensive\n(Non-availability in real time)\nGlobal Products\nLY products (Large and \nYeagre, 2001)\nSatellite – Model merged\nRegional products\nFast and Simple\nEmpirical relations\n(Shinoda et al, 1998)\nSource\nAdvantage\nDisadvantage\nAtmospheric models\n(Reanalysis products)\nGlobal Products\nInaccurate\nSparse observations\nAccurate\nhourly\nBuoy Observations\n~10 km/\nDaily\n1°/ \nDaily\n1°/ \n3-hourly\n280 km/\n3-hourly\n1-2°/\n6-hourly\nSpatial/\nTemporal \nRes.\nComputationally expensive\n(Non-availability in real time)\nGlobal Product\nGEWEX\n(Satellite data + RT models)\nComputationally expensive\n(Non-availability in real time)\nGlobal Product\nISCCP\n(Satellite data + RT models)\nComputationally expensive\n(Non-availability in real time)\nGlobal Products\nLY products (Large and \nYeagre, 2001)\nSatellite – Model merged\nRegional products\nFast and Simple\nEmpirical relations\n(Shinoda et al, 1998)\nSource\nAdvantage\nDisadvantage\nAtmospheric models\n(Reanalysis products)\nGlobal Products\nInaccurate\nTable-1 SOURCES OF SWR\n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 79 \n \n6.3. Physical basis of the SWR Algorithm \nThe OLR-based SWR estimates have better accuracy for convective regions because the variations \nof surface insolation over the warm pool ocean region are primarily due to the variations in \ncloudiness. Variations in cloudiness are manifestation of deep convection; therefore, OLR is a good \nproxy for convection. Shinoda et al [1998] showed in their study that the coefficient of correlations \nbetween SWR and OLR were maximum (~0.8) at the equator that decreases as one goes away from \nthe equator and reduces to less than 0.5 beyond 10˚N/S latitudes.  \nShinoda et al. [1998] proposed a simple empirical relationship (referred hereafter as SH98), valid \nover warm pool oceanic regions, to estimate the daily averaged SWR from the daily averaged OLR \nproducts obtained from the NOAA polar orbiting satellite. Shahi et al. [2010], proposed the use of \na high temporal resolution data of OLR to improve the diurnal sampling in order to match that of \nthe buoy SWR in computing daily averaged estimates. They demonstrated a significant \nimprovement in the SH98 by using daytime average of OLR obtained from half-hourly \ngeostationary satellite observations. The rationale behind using the daytime OLR as against daily \n(24-hr average OLR) is that the daily averaged SWR is affected solely by the presence of day-time \nclouds, and therefore the algorithm performs better than that used in SH98. The empirical \nrelationship developed by Shahi et al [2010], however, was developed for a single buoy location, \nand is not valid over other locations, particularly over different latitude regions. Shahi et al. [2011] \nfurther improved the algorithm to make it valid over a wide Indian Ocean region by including the \nsolar zenith angle in the empirical formulations. The detailed formulation is given in the following \nsection. \n6.4. Formulation of the SWR Algorithm \nThe improved algorithm developed at Space Applications Centre (SAC) to compute the SWR from \nOLR observations from geostationary satellites is described in detail by Shahi et al. [2011]. The \nmethodology was developed using a large collocated dataset of the spatially well distributed (in \nlatitude) buoy measured SWR and the half-hourly estimates of OLR from geostationary satellite \nobservations over Indian Ocean region. The generalization of the empirical relationship has been \nachieved by normalizing the SWR values to nadir locations by making use of the solar zenith angle \ninformation.  \nThe in-situ SWR is the down-welling shortwave radiation measured by the Research Moored Array \nfor African-Asian-Australian Monsoon Analysis and Prediction (RAMA) buoy. Daily average \nshortwave radiation is computed as a 24 hour average. Fig.1 shows the locations of the 13 RAMA \nbuoys in the warm pool region of Indian Ocean used for the algorithm development for the period \nof 2002-2009.  The OLR products have been obtained from EUMETSAT for the Indian Ocean \ncoverage of the Meteosat-5 (sub-satellite point at 57°E) upto December 2006 and Meteosat-7 (sub-\nsatellite point at 63°E) beyond January 2007. Meteosat derived OLR was estimated from the half-\nhourly observations in the thermal infrared (TIR, 10.5-12.5µm) and water vapor absorption (WV, \n5.7-7.1µm) channels at spatial resolution of 5 km, using the algorithm developed by Schmetz and \nLiu [1988]. The accuracy of geostationary satellite derived OLR is shown to be ~3 W m-2 [Schmetz \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 80 \n \nand Liu, 1988; Singh et al., 2007] using radiative transfer model based simulation studies. The \nvalidation of geostationary satellite derived OLR with the broadband OLR observations from the \nClouds and Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) onboard polar orbiting satellites TRMM and \nEOS-Terra reveal the accuracy to be ~7 W m-2 at a daily time-scale [Ba et al., 2003].  \nA collocated dataset of daily averaged SWR (24-hr average) using buoy data and daytime averaged \nOLR (duration of sunshine) was generated for each of the buoy locations. The daytime averaged \nOLR is obtained using average of the half-hourly observations between sunrise to sunset (computed \nusing solar zenith angle less than 80o).  A training dataset, using collocated observations from each \nof the buoys that represent complete annual cycle, was created for the algorithm development and \nthe remaining data treated as the independent testing dataset.  \nSAC-Algorithm [Shahi et al., 2011] o used the normalized SWR w.r.t. the nadir viewing angle, i.e. \nSWR sec2(), in the empirical formulation, where  is solar zenith angle at local noon. The \npolynomial least square equation between normalized SWR and OLR was found to be:     \n (SWR) sec2() =  -0.002434 (OLR)2 + 2.5401 (OLR) – 220.75 \nwhich provides the final expression for computing the SWR as: \nSWR = cos2() [-0.002434 (OLR)2 + 2.5401 (OLR) – 220.75] \n \nFigure 1: Locations of RAMA buoys in Indian Ocean overlaid on a sample Meteosat \nOLR coverage \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 81 \n \nThe improved algorithm is referred as SAC-SWR Algorithm. The root-mean-squared-error \n(RMSE) computed for SAC-SWR estimates from the buoy observations was found to be ~28 W \nm-2 in the testing dataset in contrast to the ~39 W m-2 obtained using SH98. \nThe SAC-SWR algorithm was also compared with other datasets for the year 2007 available from: \n(i) Global Energy and Water-Cycle Experiment Surface Radiation Budget (GEWEX-SRB) project \nof NASA World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), (ii) International Satellite Cloud \nClimatology Project Surface Radiative Flux Dataset (ISCCP-FD), and (iii) National Center for \nEnvironmental Prediction (NCEP) analysis. The Spatial resolution of GEWEX-SRB, ISCCP-FD \nand NCEP SWR products are 1°, 2.8° and 1.875°, respectively. The RMSE computed for different \nSWR products from buoy SWR shows that RMSE for SAC-SWR is lowest for the entire range of \nSWR values, indicating that the accuracy of the SAC-SWR is best under all sky conditions \nfollowed closely by GEWEX-SWR.  \nFor combined dataset RMSE for SAC-SWR is 27.3 W m-2, which is the smallest, followed by \n32.7, 37.5 and 59.6 W m-2, respectively, for GEWEX, ISCCP and NCEP SWR products. The \nestimate of the standard error on weekly time scales is much smaller than that on daily time \nscales, with values of 11.8, 13.4, 15.3, and 32.8 Wm−2 for SAC, GEWEX, ISCCP, and NCEP \nproducts, respectively. \n \n \n \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 82 \n \n6.5.

Algorithm Specification \n \n7.2. Background \nNumerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models has become an indispensable tool for providing \nweather forecast. These models are immensely benefited from various in-situ and satellite \nobservations. These observations are used for correcting model forecast trajectories, model output \nvalidation and model parameter tuning. Ingestion of various observations has now become a state-\nof-art and also rapidly growing to meet the challenges posed by huge amount of available \nobservations. With the advancement and maturing of data assimilation (DA) techniques direct \nsatellite observed radiance (or brightness temperatures) are operationally assimilated by various \noperational agencies. Assimilation of satellite observed radiances can be primarily subdivided into \ntwo classes: assimilation of clear sky brightness temperature and assimilation of all sky (clear and \ncloudy both) observation.  Though, cloudy regions probably have a large impact on the accuracy \nof the NWP model predictions (McNally 2002; Kumar et al. 2014), but the direct assimilation of \ncloudy radiances is still beyond the scope of existing global NWP systems (Pavelin et al. 2008). This \nis due to the fact, that assimilation of cloudy radiances requires an observation operator having \nrealistic representation of cloud effects, and a NWP model capable of accurately representing \ncloud at same scales (Chevallier et al. 2004). Such kind of capabilities of existing NWP model is in \ndevelopment phase and fast radiative transfer (RT) model have large uncertainties over cloudy \nregions, and have complex nonlinearity in assimilation when clouds exist (Bauer et al. 2011). \nTherefore, cloudy infrared (IR) radiance is still part of ongoing research and development activities \nand is not the part of operational assimilation system. Nevertheless, the method of assimilation of \nclear sky brightness temperature (satellite observation which are not affected by the presence of \nclouds) has already reached to matured stage, therefore, used operationally in providing weather \nforecast. Thus clear sky brightness temperature (CSBT) is a very important parameter from the \nNWP data assimilation applications.  clear sky radiance assimilation has become the indispensable \npart of assimilation system. For clear sky radiance assimilation, it is essential to eliminate the \ncloudy pixels in order to retain only clear-sky radiances only. Usually a binary mask (clear/cloudy) \nVersion \nDate \nPrepared by \nDescription \n1.0  \n \n01.03.2018 \nM. V. Shukla, \nP. K. Thapliyal, and  \nC. M.

Objective \nThe main objective of this document is to provide the theoretical basis for calculating clear sky \nbrightness temperature (CSBT) for INSAT-3D/3DR TIR-1 and water vapor channels. The proposed \nalgorithm will be applied to estimate CSBT over 0.50x0.50 field of regard (FOR) along with \nstatistical parameters and a confidence flag that will help in using CSBT value in DA process. \nCSBT product is calculated for only clear pixels identified by INSAT-3D/3DR imager cloud mask \n(CMK) product. The algorithm has no limitation based on geographical location, therefore, can be \napplied to generate products over full disk or sector products. Nevertheless, the CSBT product is \ngenerated from only full disk product.  \n7.4. Inputs \n7.4.1.

Algorithm Functional Specifications \n7.5.1. Overview \nThe clear sky brightness temperature (CSBT) from INSAT-3D/3DR imager is intended to be \ngenerated at 0.50x0.50 field of regard (FOR). CSBT product is generated at much coarser resolution \nthan the actual resolution of INSAT-3D/3DR imager observations which are available at nominal \nresolution of ~4 km at nadir for TIR-1, TIR-2, MIR and ~8 km for water vapor.  The gridding \n(averaging) over all pixels within 0.50x0.50 FOR. This averaging is done to enhance the signal to \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 88 \n \nnoise ratio and to make observation less correlated. Data assimilation warrants very accurate, and \nuncorrelated observations. CSBT product is aimed towards providing observations. \n7.5.2. Generation of CSBT \nAs it is evident from the name of parameter, CSBT is generated for clear sky pixels. Since this \nproduct is mainly used in NWP data assimilation, it is re-gridded at coarser resolution of 0.50x0.50 \ngrid. This helps in reducing noise in value in BT as well as creating uncorrelated observations. \nGeneration of CSBT involves following steps: \n7.5.3. Preparation of latitude-longitude grid \nINSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR are orbiting in geostationary orbit and are located at 83.0 0E and 74 \n0E, respectively. Therefore, the geographical extent of observed area by both the satellites is \ndifferent particularly in east-west direction. As both the satellites are in geostationary orbit, thus in \nprinciple, the viewing location of each pixel does not vary for different acquisitions. Based on the \nfixed grid of INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR, a latitude-longitude equal grid is selected and all further \nprocessing in done the same grid.  \nFor INSAT-3D grid information is as follows: \nMin Latitude = -81.0;        grid size=0.5 ;     grid points in north-south direction=325 \nMin Longitude = 1.0;        grid size=0.50 ;    grid points in east-west direction=325 \nFor INSAT-3D grid information is as follows: \nMin Latitude = -81.0;        grid size=0.5 ;     grid points in north-south direction=325 \nMin Longitude = -3.0;        grid size=0.50 ;    grid points in east-west direction=325 \n7.5.4. Averaging of parameters \nA simple box average method is adopted to generate parameters. CSBT, satellite zenith angle and \nsolar zenith angle and land fraction (for a given grid) are generated. In data assimilation, satellite \nand solar zenith angles and land fraction are required along with CSBT. As already stated that \nCSBT is calculated for clear pixels only, therefore, for averaging operational cloud mask product \nis also used. INSAT-3D/3DR operational cloud mask product provides a flag which has one of the \nfour values 0,1,2 and 3. 0 indicates clear pixel, 1 indicates cloudy pixel, 3 is representative of \nprobably clear pixel and 3 indicates probably cloudy pixel. While calculating average of \naforementioned parameters, the total of pixels (N), clear pixels (N1) and probably clear pixels (N2) \nwithin a given grid are also counted. These counts (N, N1 and N2) determine whether CSBT \nproduct will be computed for a given grid or not. A dynamic threshold which is 10% of total count \nvalue N is taken. If total number of clear and probable clear pixels (N1+N2) is less than the \nthreshold value and CSBT and other products are not generated, but if this is greater than the \nthreshold value then it is checked if N1 is also greater then threshold or not. However, in both the \ncases CSBT and other parameters are computed but if N1 is less than the threshold then quality \nflag of CSBT is termed as not very good quality.  \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 89 \n \nIn addition to the average of parameters, standard deviation of BT for a given box is also computed. \nThis standard deviation is also provided along with CSBT values to help in deciding the spread of \nBT value for a given box. More standard deviation may help in flagging out some of the CSBT \nvalue as it may have some contamination of cloud (or cloud edges) \n7.5.5. Quality indicators \nAs it is already discussed in previous section that a flag and standard deviation values are generated \nalong with CSBT product to provide user an indication of quality of CSBT value. The major \nconfidence in quality is determined by the number of clear pixels with a grid box, if more than 50% \nof grid is covered by clear pixels then that box is given the highest confidence flag 0, but if this \nnumber is between 25 to 50% the flag=1 and if it between 10 to 25% then flag=2. \nThese various flags are given to user to give them a flexibility in optimizing the number of data \npoints in assimilation and the quality of data set.   \n7.6 Outputs \n7.6.1 Format of the output and the domain \n7.7. Validation \n7.7.1. Data required   \nClear-sky brightness temperature (CSBT) from INSAT-3D/3DR imager will be carried out by using \nvarious analysis such as NCMRWF analysis, GFS analysis and various reanalysis such as ERA \ninterim reanalysis. These various analysis and reanalysis will be used to generate brightness \ntemperatures using RTTOV or CRTM radiative transfer models. The validation cannot be carried \nout for each half-hourly product but validation will be carried out for only synoptic hours.  \nFor validation at specific time period special launch campaign is needed wherein various \nradiosondes are launched and these soundings could be used in conjunction with radiative transfer \nmodel for CSBT validation.  \n  \n \n \n \n \nParameter \nUnit \nMin \nMax \nAccuracy \nResolution \nFormat \nClear Sky \nbrightness \ntemperature \nK \n \n180.0 \n340.0 \n1-2K \n0.5 x 0.5  \nHDF5 \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 90 \n \nTable 5 \n \nReferences \nBauer P, Auligne T, Bell W, Geer A, Guidard V, Heilliette S, Kazumori M, Kim MJ, Liu EHC, \nMcNally AP, Macpherson B, Okamoto K, Renshaw R, Riishøjgaard LP. 2011.

Introduction \nThe aim of Clear-sky brightness temperature (CSBT) product is provide area average brightness \ntemperatures (Tb) for representing cloud free pixels. These products have been recently developed \nby Space Applications Centre under INSAT Meteorological Data Processing System (IMDPS) \nproject to be used in radiance assimilation in the numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. The \nhigh-temporal resolution data of INSAT-3D Sounder (hourly observations) would be extremely \nuseful for monitoring and predicting of the fast developing weather systems through 4D-VAR \nradiance assimilation in NP models.  \n8.3. Algorithm Description \nThe following sections provide details of the procedure for generating CSBT products: \n8.3.1. Cloud detection \nThe first step in CSBT product generation is to filter out cloud contaminated pixels from the \nSounder observations and generate a cloud-flag for each of the pixels. This section provides the \nphysical basis for detection of the cloudy pixels from INSAT-3D Sounder observations. The output \nof cloud mask algorithm gives the degree of presence of a cloud in it. This information enables the \nsubsequent steps to use this information for further processing. \nThe cloud detection algorithm is carried out in three steps. The flow chart is shown in fig.1. \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 93 \n \n \nFig.1: Flow chart of the Sounder cloud detection algorithm \nThe cloud detection methodology for INSAT-3D sounder follows operational GOES sounder cloud \ndetection procedure developed by Schreiner et al. (2001). This cloud detection algorithm uses 4 \ninfrared channels and a visible channel during daytime for cloud detection and 5 infrared channels \nfor the detection of nighttime clouds. One additional infrared channel is used to detect clouds \nappearing at dawn time. The various channels used in cloud detection are summarized below: \nCh#3 - 13.3 µm (“CO2 absorption”, used for detection of thin cirrus) \nCh#6 - 12.6 µm  (“Moderate WV-absorption”, used in detecting some low level inversions) \nCh#7 - 12.0 µm  (“Weak WV-absorption”, used in detecting low clouds and fog) \nCh#8 - 11.0 µm  (“Longwave Window”, used in detecting various level of clouds) \nCh#17 - 4.0 µm  (“Shortwave Window”, used to detect low clouds and fog at night) \nCh#18 - 3.8 µm  (“Shortwave Window”, used to detect low clouds after sunrise) \nCh#19 - 0.6 µm  (“Visible” band used in detecting various level of clouds during daylight) \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 94 \n \nA series of tests are applied using these channels to detect stratus, cirrus (thin and opaque), fog, \nsnow and inversion. Here for cloud detection algorithm a 3x3 pixel field-of-regard (FOR) is used. \nThe FOR is moved by 1 pixel sequentially in E-W and N-S (along and across the scan-line) to \nmaximize the clear FOR detection. Two types of cloud flags are generated one each for the FOV \n(single pixel) and FOR (3 x 3 pixel box). In present algorithm the output contains three types of \ncloud-flags that are given by: \n0: Clear \n1: Cloudy \n2: Partially cloudy  \nThe cloud detection procedure is carried out in three steps to filters out cloudy pixels very \naccurately and efficiently:   \n(a). The first step is a very gross check and is applied on a FOR of 3x3 pixel box. If it fails in the \nfirst check then the whole FOR is declared as cloudy and it moves to the next FOR. In case of \npassing the first step a series of tests are applied on the FOR in second step. In third and final step, \na series of tests are applied on each FOV and the results of these tests decide the final outcome.  \n(b). Primary Array Flag (PAF): This is first step of cloud detection to generate the primary array \nflag. Four tests are applied on a FOR to generate PAF. Generation of PAF requires computation of \ntwo thresholds Tmax and Tmin from ancillary information. Tmax and Tmin are computed using surface \nskin temperature information which is available either through AWS or from model forecast. Here \nmodel forecast is used for surface skin temperature.  \nTmax= TS + 20, and Tmin= TS - 20 \nWhere, TS is the surface skin temperature. After this calculation the following checks are applied: \n1) Visible reflectance of the warmest pixel in FOR computed from Ch#8 (11µm) must be less than \na certain threshold value. The value of threshold for visible channel over land is 25% and over \nwater is 7%. The value of threshold may vary for low surface temperature and low sun angles. If \nthe surface skin temperature is less than 273K the threshold value over land is increased by a factor \nof 1.5. Similarly, to take care of low sun angles the land limit is multiplied by solar zenith angle. \nThis test is possible only for day time. \n2) The Ch#8 Tb (11µm) of warmest pixel must be less than Tmax and must be greater than Tmin.  \n3) Inversion test is applied on the difference of maximum Ch#8 Tb (11µm) and maximum Ch#18 \nTb (3.8 µm) within FOR. This test is applicable only during night time. For this test a threshold \n(Th1) is calculated using an empirical relation using the NET value of Ch#8 and Ch#18. \nDifference between the warmest pixel of Ch#18 and the warmest pixel of Ch#8 must be greater \nthan the Th1 for a pixel to be clear.  \nIf any of these tests fail, then the whole box is assumed to be cloudy and not processed further, \notherwise it will proceed for secondary array flag (SAF) procedure. \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 95 \n \n(c). Secondary Array Flag (SAF): The first step of SAF is to compute skin temperature \nempirically using three channels, Ch#8 (Tb8), Ch#7 (Tb7) and Ch#18 (Tb18) and two channels Ch#8 \n(11µm) and Ch#7 (12µm). These empirical relations for skin temperature are as follows:  \nTS3 = a0 + a1*Tb8 + a2* Tb7 + a3* Tb18              (using 3 channels) \nTS2 = b0 + b1* Tb8 + a2* Tb7  \n \n   (using 2 channels) \nThese coefficients are pre-determined from a large simulated matchup dataset. The standard tests \nfor SAF are following:  \n The difference between TS3 and TS2 must not be greater than 2K.  \n The “cold sea test” only over ocean and this test fail if the highest Tb8 in FOR FOV is less \nthan 270K. \n The “reflected sunglint test” checks the difference between brightness temperatures for the \nhighest Tb8 and Tb18. The difference must be less than 10K. \nIf any of these SAF test is fail then the whole FOR is assigned as cloudy. Otherwise clear flag is \nassigned to whole FOR. SAF is followed by final and Individual FOV Flag (IFF). In IFF series of \ntests are applied to individual FOV of a given box. \n(d). Individual FOV Flag (IFF):  \nSnow test: This test is daytime test and discriminates between snow and cloud. If visible \nreflectance of FOV is greater than the minimum reflectance (already defined in PAF) and skin \ntemperature is greater than a threshold (275K) then FOV is cloudy otherwise clear. Threshold in \nthis case can be adjusted to any value in the range of 273 to 285 K. \nSecondary stratus test: In this test difference of moisture corrected Tb7 and Tb8 is compared with \na threshold.  The threshold depends on Tb7 and difference of skin temperature (Ts) and surface air \ntemperature (Ta), both from forecast.  \nTh2 = max[ NET(Ch7), 0.25*(Ta-Ts)], here Ts is calculated using 2 or 3 channels depending on \ndaytime and nighttime situation. \nTPW=max(Tb8) – max(Tb7),    in 3x3 pixel FOR  \nTb7(corrected) = Tb7 + TPW \nCirrus test: If the Tb5 of FOV under consideration is less than the value of noise corrected Tb5 \nvalue corresponding to FOV having maximum Tb8 in the given FOR, then the test is said to be \nfailed. \nTb5(Noise corrected) = {Tb5 corresponding to max(Tb8)} - 7.0*NET(Ch#5) \nFinal skin temperature test:  \n[Tb8 + {Tb8 – Tb7}@max(Tb7)] < Ts, then test is assumed to be fail. \nIf one FOV passes all the tests then that FOV is upgraded to clear. If FOV fails any of the tests then \nit is flagged as cloudy or partially cloudy depending on the SAF flag. \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 96 \n \n8.3.2. Clear-Sky Brightness Temperature computation \nThe CSBT product at for pixel is computed as average of the clear-sky pixel brightness \ntemperatures in the 3x3 FOR centered at the pixel location, if at least 3 clear pixels are found in \nthe FOR. The averaging reduces the impact due to the uncertainty in cloud-detection algorithm as \nwell as reduces the random noise of measurements (NET) over individual pixels. The land/sea \nflag as well as the clear fraction in the FOR is also computed.

Background \nThe purpose of this document is to present an algorithm for retrieving Cloud properties such as \ncloud top temperature, cloud top pressure and effective cloud amount from two INSAT-3D thermal \ninfrared window channels (10.5-11.5 m, and 11.5-12.5 m) and water vapor (6.7 m) channels. \nThis document also describes the validation procedure. In this document some background and the \nmethodology employed to derive the cloud top temperature/pressure and effective cloud amount is \ndiscussed. It mainly discusses the theoretical basis and practical aspects of the retrieval algorithm \nfor cloud parameters from INSAT-3D imager channels and outlines the intended validation \napproach with validation results. \nThe cloud properties such as cloud cover, cloud height etc. are very important for various climate \nand weather applications. The clouds at different heights affects weather and climate phenomenon \nin different ways. It is very difficult to imagine variety of weather phenomenon without clouds. \nClouds do not only add beauty and variability in atmosphere but also cause the wide variety of \natmospheric activities. Clouds vary in its appearance, extent, composition and physical properties, \ntherefore, different clouds affect weather and climate differently. For example, rapidly growing \ncumulus clouds are precursor to sever thunderstorm, low water clouds with strong temperature \ninversion results in fog. Thin cirrus clouds do not play a critical role in short to medium range \nweather activities, but they play a very crucial role in earth’s heat budget and also helps in tracking \nupper level winds. Thin cirrus clouds are thin enough to allow incoming solar radiation to pass \nthrough it but doesn’t allow outgoing infrared radiation, thus increases the radiative energy and \neventually leads to the warming of earth-atmosphere system.  \nCirrus clouds are crucially important to global radiative processes and the heat balance of the Earth; \nthey allow solar heating while reducing infrared radiation to space.

Past estimates of the variation of cloud cover and the Earth's outgoing longwave radiation \nhave been derived primarily from the longwave infrared window (10-12 µm) radiances observed \nfrom polar orbiting and geostationary satellites (Rossow and Lacis, 1990; Gruber and Chen, 1988). \nThe occurrence of semi-transparent clouds is often underestimated in these single channel \napproaches. Recently, multispectral techniques have been used to better detect cirrus in global \n(Wylie et al., 2005; Wu and Susskind, 1990) and North American (Wylie and Menzel, 1989) cloud \nstudies. \nAdditionally, clouds are very important to study weather phenomena at various spatial and temporal \nscales including its diurnal cycle. Diurnal cycle of various physical processes such as radiative \nexchange, precipitation, small and large-scale dynamics are of great importance and are greatly \nlinked with clouds, therefore, underlines the study of diurnal cycles of clouds too. Ackerman and \nCox (1981) had reported the diurnal oscillation of cloudiness in some tropical areas. These diurnal \noscillations are part of dynamic-radiative feedback mechanism that operates on various spatial \nscales. (Foltz and Gray, 1979) \n9.3. Objective \nThe main objective of this document is to provide the theoretical basis for deriving cloud top \npressure/ cloud top temperature and effective cloud amount from INSAT-3D/3DR imager channels. \nThe proposed algorithm will be applied to retrieve cloud properties from imager channels over \neach pixel defined as confidently cloudy from CMK product. The algorithm has no limitation based \non geographical location, therefore, can be applied to generate products over full disk or sector \nproducts. \n9.4. Inputs \n9.4.1.

Algorithm Functional Specifications \n9.5.1. Overview \nThe cloud top pressure/temperature and cloud effective emissivity from INSAT-3D/3DR imager is \nintended to be retrieved at ~50 km nominal resolution. The cloud products are retrieved at coarser \nresolution than to resolution of actual INSAT-3D/3DR imager observations which are available at \nnominal resolution of ~4 km at nadir.  The averaging over a Field of Regard (FOR) of 9x9 pixels \nis used to enhance the signal to noise ratio over cloudy pixels. In general, noise over cloudy pixels \nis higher in comparison to clear pixels, therefore, it becomes essential to take average of observed \nradiances/brightness temperatures to reduce the noise for accurate estimation of cloud properties.   \nFor each 9x9 pixel box cloud top pressure, cloud top temperature and effective cloud amount is \nretrieved using Infrared window channel method or water vapor - window intercept method. \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 103 \n \nGenerally, window method does not give accurate retrievals over semi-transparent thin high clouds, \ntherefore, water vapor - window intercept method is used over those FOR.  \n9.5.2. Infrared Window Channel (WIN) method \nIn this method the height assignment using a single satellite channel is made by comparing either \ninfrared window or water vapor brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model forecast \ntemperature profiles. However, for INSAT-3D/3DR Imager at present only Infrared window \nobservations are used in this method. Cloud heights are determined by interpolating the cloud \ntemperature, which is an average of coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess field at \nthe target location. A 6-h NWP model forecast from National Center for Environmental Prediction \n(NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) is the source of temperature profile. This method works \nwell with opaque clouds.  \n9.5.3. Water Vapor−Infrared Window Intercept Method (H2O)  \nCloud top pressure derived with this method are based on the fact that radiances from two different \nspectral bands are linearly related for different cloud amounts within the field of regard at a \nspecified height. Observed radiance measurements are a function of clear sky and opaque cloud \nradiances.     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nc\nbcd\ncl\nP\nN\nnER\nN\nR\nnE\nN\nR\n,\n1\n\n\n\n              \n \n \n \n  (1) \nOpaque cloud radiance can be calculated from: \n\n\n\n\n\n\ndp\ndp\np\nT\nN\ndb\nP\nN\nt\nN\nR\nP\nN\nR\ns\nc\np\np\ncl\nc\nbcd\n)\n(\n,\n,\n,\n\n\n\n       \n \n \n(2) \nWhere, \nbcd\nR\n is the opaque (\"black\") cloud radiance, Rc1 is the clear sky radiance, t(N,p) is the \nfractional transmittance for radiation in spectral band N emitted from the atmospheric layer at \npressure p arriving at the top of the atmosphere (p=0), n is the fraction of FOR covered with cloud, \nPs is the surface pressure, Pc is the cloud top pressure, and b[N,T(p)] is the Planck radiance of the \nspectral band N for a temperature T(p). The second part of the above equation represents the \nradiance decrease from clear sky conditions introduced by an opaque cloud at a pressure level p. \nThis calculation is dependent upon an \"accurate\" estimation of the current atmospheric temperature \nand moisture structure, which are provided by a NWP model forecast profile. By comparing the \nobserved radiances with the calculated radiances (for an observed atmosphere defined by the model \nguess profiles), an estimation of the cloud height can be derived for a completely opaque cloud. In \nthe Fig. 1, observed WV and IR radiances at each Field of Regard (FOR) are plotted with the \ncalculated radiances at different heights for opaque clouds in the atmosphere (curved line). The \nstraight line connects the center points of the warmest and coldest clusters, which approximates the \nobserved surface and cloud conditions. \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 104 \n \n          \n \nFig 1: Measured radiances (mW m−2 sr−1 cm) for fields of view partially filled with clouds (Nieman et al., \n1993) \nBy extrapolating this line to intersect the calculated radiance curve, where the cloud amount is one \n(representing an opaque cloud), the cloud top temperature/pressure can be determined. The cluster \ndetermination algorithm used is a modified version of the bivariate asymmetric Gaussian histogram \nanalysis (Rossow et al., 1985; Tomassini, 1981), and it involves ten steps. These steps are outlined \nin detail in Nieman et al. (1993) and Nieman et al. (1997). Calculated water vapor radiances can \nbe in error due to incorrect NWP model forecast profiles. This error would lead to calculated \nradiances being systematically higher or lower than observed radiances. When the calculated \nradiances are systematically lower, an adjustment is applied to the radiances obtained using the \nabove equation (2). When the calculated radiances are greater than observed radiances, no \nadjustment is applied since it is assumed that the lower measured radiance is due to cloud \ncontamination. The accuracy of this method can be affected by the amount of water vapor in the \natmosphere. Dry atmospheric conditions lead to a steeper slope between the IR and WV radiances, \nleading to an overestimate in the target height (lower pressure value). The NCEP GFS model \nforecast are used here as the guess fields. \nAfter retrieving the value of cloud top pressure effective cloud amount or effective emissivity is \ncomputed using eq (3) \nA\u0017BB =\nD(E)\u0018DFG(E)\nH[E,K(LF)]\u0018DFG(E)                                                                                                 (3)  \nwhere N is the fractional cloud cover within the FOV,  NO the effective cloud amount,  is the \nwindow channel wavenumber, and P[Q, R(ST)] , is the opaque cloud radiance corresponding to \nwindow channel frequency and UTVW(Q) is the clear sky radiance corresponding to window channel. \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 105 \n \n9.5.4.

Radiance bias adjustment \n It is evident from the previous sections that cloud top properties retrieval algorithm is heavily \ndependent on quality of NCEP forecast fields and the fast forward RT model. If forward simulations \nare not in consonance with observations, then there will be error in the retrieved products. To make \nobservations and forward model simulations consistent, a radiance bias adjustment is necessary \nstep.  \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 106 \n \nRadiance bias adjustment is carried out by using previous eight days of good quality matchup data \nof INSAT-3D/3DR Imager clear-sky observations and spatially and temporally collocated \nsimulated INSAT-3D/3DR Imager radiances. The simulation is carried out by using NCEP GFS \nanalysis and RTTOV radiative transfer model.  In this matchup data set INSAT-3D/3DR clear sky \nobservations are average over 9x9 FOR and only those FOR are selected in which more than 90% \npixels are clear. The radiance bias adjustment is done for land and ocean pixels separately. In \naddition to it, only those points are taken up for matchup data wherein satellite zenith angle is less \nthan 300. An outlier rejection method is also applied before computing radiance bias adjustment \nfactor in terms of slope and offset.  \n \nReferences \nAckerman, S. A., and S. K.

Algorithm Functional Specifications \nIt is very difficult to imagine variety of weather phenomenon without clouds. Clouds do not only \nadd beauty and variability in atmosphere but also cause the wide variety of atmospheric activities. \nClouds very in its appearance, extent, composition and physical properties, therefore, different \nclouds affect weather and climate differently. For example, rapidly growing cumulus clouds are \nprecursor to sever thunderstorm, low water clouds with strong temperature inversion results in fog. \nThin cirrus clouds are not very exciting clouds from short to medium range weather activities but \nplay a very crucial role in earth’s heat budget and also helps in tracking upper level winds. Thin \ncirrus clouds are thin enough to allow incoming solar radiation to pass through it but doesn’t allow \noutgoing infrared radiation thus increase the radiative energy and eventually leads to the warming \nof earth-atmosphere system.  \nCirrus clouds are crucially important to global radiative processes and the heat balance of the \nEarth; they allow solar heating while reducing infrared radiation to space. Models of climate \nchanges will have to correctly simulate these clouds to have the proper radiative terms for the \nEarth's heat budget. Past estimates of the variation of cloud cover and the Earth's outgoing \nlongwave radiation have been derived primarily from the longwave infrared window (10-12 m) \nradiances observed from polar orbiting and geostationary satellites (Rossow and Lacis, 1990; \nGruber and Chen, 1988). The occurrence of semi-transparent clouds is often underestimated in \nthese single channel approaches. Recently, multispectral techniques have been used to better detect \ncirrus in global (Wylie et al., 2005; Wu and Susskind, 1990) and North American (Wylie and \nMenzel, 1989) cloud studies. \nClouds are very important to study at various spatial and temporal scale including its diurnal cycle. \nDiurnal cycle of various physical processes such as radiative exchange, precipitation, small and \nlarge-scale dynamics are of great importance and are greatly linked with clouds, therefore, \nunderlines the study of diurnal cycles of clouds too. Ackerman and Cox (1981) had reported the \ndiurnal oscillation of cloudiness in some tropical areas. These diurnal oscillations are part of \ndynamic-radiative feedback mechanism that operates on various spatial scales (Foltz and Gray, \n1979).     \nThe cloud top pressure/temperature and cloud effective emissivity from INSAT-3D/3DR sounder \nis intended to be retrieved at ~50 km nominal resolution. The cloud products are retrieved at \ncoarser resolution than to resolution of actual INSAT-3D/3DR sounder observations which are \navailable at nominal resolution of ~10 km at nadir.  The averaging of 5x5 pixels will enhance the \nsignal to noise ratio over cloudy pixels. In general, noise over cloudy pixels is higher in comparison \nto clear pixels, therefore, it becomes essential to take average of observed radiances/brightness \ntemperatures to reduce the noise for accurate estimation of cloud properties.   \nCloud properties from INSAT-3D/3DR sounder observations are very important parameters to \nstudy diurnal, seasonal or annual variations in cloud cover as these parameters are available at high \ntemporal resolution at the same geographical location. These parameters could also help in \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 112 \n \nsegregating semi-transparent transmissive clouds (partially transparent to terrestrial radiation) \nopaque clouds in the analysis of cloud cover (Wylie and Menzel, 1989). Similar kind of studies \nare already carried out by Wylie et al. (1994) using NOAA-HIRS observations.  \n10.5. Algorithm Theoretical Description \nThis section presents the theoretical basis of the algorithm and practical considerations.   Retrieval \nof cloud products (CTP, CTT and effective cloud amount) is a combination of two methods: \nWindow channel method and CO2 slicing method. Both of these methods require forecast fields of \ntemperature and moisture. The CO2 slicing method requires the use of radiative transfer model.   \nIn this section physics of deriving cloud height and effective cloud amount from INSAT-3D/3DR \nsounder observations is discussed. This sections presents the conceptual framework of retrieval \nalgorithm.  \n10.6. Physical Basis of the Cloud Top Pressure/Temperature/Height \nAlgorithm \n10.6.1. CO2 Slicing: Mid- to High-Level Clouds \nThe assumptions made for the application of the CO2 -slicing algorithm are (Menzel et al., 1992):  \n(i) \nthe emissivity of the cloud is the same in all channels used,  \n(ii) \nclouds occur as a single cloud layer,  \n(iii) \nlower cloud layers are ignored, and  \n(iv) \nthe surface temperature and the temperature structure of the atmosphere and its \ntransmittance at the used wavelengths are known. \nRetrieval of cloud top pressure and effective cloud amount (i.e., cloud fraction multiplied by cloud \nemittance) are performed using radiances measured in those spectral bands that are located within \nthe broad 15 m CO2 absorption region. The CO2 slicing technique makes use of combination of \n15 m CO2 absorption channels that have different opacity, therefore, sensing different layer of \natmosphere. This helps in assigning height of clouds. The channels of INSAT-3D/3DR used in the \ncloud top pressure and amount algorithm are described in Table 1. \n \n \n \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 113 \n \nTable 1: Channel characteristics of INSAT-3D used in cloud top properties retrieval \nINSAT-3D \nChannel \nnumber \nINSAT-3D Channel characteristics  \nPrincipal \nAbsorbing \ngas \nApproximate peak in \nweighting function \nCentral \nwavelength \n(wavenumber) \nBandwidth  \nµm (cm-1) \n8 \n10.99 (910) \n0.611 (51) \nWindow \nSurface \n7 \n11.98 (834) \n0.768 (53) \nWater Vapor \nSurface \n5 \n13.33 (750) \n0.352 (20) \nCO2 \nLow level atmosphere \n4 \n13.64 (733) \n0.351 (19) \nCO2 \nMid-level atmosphere \n3 \n14.03 (713) \n0.321 (16) \nCO2 \nUpper level atmosphere \n2 \n14.31 (699) \n0.305 (15) \nCO2 \nTropopause level \n \nThe CO2 slicing method is a well-established method and is extensively used for deriving cloud \nproperties from a wide range of GEO and LEO satellite observations. Keeping this fact in mind \nthe latest series of GOES-12/13/14 had a CO2 channel instead of the split window thermal IR \nchannel. This method is used for deriving cloud top pressure and temperatures from VISSR \nAtmospheric Sounder (VAS) (Menzel and Strabala 1989; Menzel et. al 1992) observations, High \nresolution Infrared Radiometer Sounder (HIRS) (Wylie and Menzel 1999) observations, \nMODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Plantick et al. 2003; Menzel et al.  \n2008) radiances and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) sounder \n(Menzel et al. 1992; Menzel and Purdom 1994) observations. Several sensitivity studies such as \nMenzel et al. (1992) and Baum and Wielicki (1994) have already been carried out to quantify errors \narising from different sources.  \nThe CO2 slicing technique can be understood by calculating the radiances using radiative transfer \nmodels in an atmosphere with a single cloud layer. For a given cloud element in a field of view \n(FOV), i.e. a single sounder pixel, the radiance observed, R(), in spectral band , can be written \nas: \nU(Q) = NUTV_ + (1 −N)UTVW                                                 ------------------- (1) \nWhere U(Q) is observed radiance in band , N is the fractional cloud coverage, UTVW is radiance \nfrom clear portion and UTV_ is radiance from the cloud covered portion. \nCloud covered radiance can be written as: \nUTV_ = OUab + (1 −O)UTVW                                                    ------------------- (2) \nWhere O is the emissivity of cloud and Uab is radiance from the opaque cloud.  \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 114 \n \nBy combining Eq (1) and Eq (2) we get:  \nU(Q) = (1 −NO)UTVW(Q) + NOUab(Q)                            ------------------- (3) \nNow from radiative transfer equation UTV_ and UTVW are given as:  \nUTV_ = P(S\u0002)c(S\u0002) −∫\nc(Q, d)\n_H[E,K(b)]\n_b\nLe\nf\ngd                 ------------------- (4) \nUTVW = P(S\u0002)c(S\u0002) −∫\nc(Q, d) _H[E,K(b)]\n_b\nLh\nf\ngd                 ------------------- (5) \nWhere S\u0005 is the surface pressure, S\u0002 is pressure corresponding to the top of single level cloud, \nc(Q, d) is the top of the atmosphere (p = 0) transmittance of radiation of spectral band  emitted \nfrom the atmospheric level at pressure p, and P[Q, R(d)] is the Planck radiance for spectral band \nfor temperature T at pressure level p. Thus first terms of Eq (4) and (5) represents the contribution \nto radiance from the surface term (which is cloud top in Eq (4) and surface in Eq(5)), whereas, the \nsecond term represents the absorption of radiation by atmosphere above the surface or cloud top. \nThese equations neglect the scattering by clouds or atmosphere which is very valid assumptions \nfor clear atmosphere and opaque clouds at the desired sounder spectral bands.  \nNow expanding above equations by integrating by parts and solving we get: \nUab(Q, ST) = UTVW(Q) −∫\nc(Q, d)\n_H[E,K(b)]\n_b\nLh\nLe\ngd                        ------------------- (6) \nNow by substituting Eq (6) in Eq (3) we get: \nU(Q) −UTVW(Q) = NO ∫\nc(Q, d)\n_H[E,K(b)]\n_b\nLe\nLh\ngd                           ------------------- (7) \nThis is the basic equation used in CO2 slicing method. It is evident from the Eq (7) that with the \nhelp of a-priori information of  UTVW(Q) and c(Q, d), value of S\u0002 that is cloud top pressure could be \ninferred. However, even with this a-priori information, there are two unknowns (NO and S\u0002) in Eq \n(7). To solve this problem, the ratio of Eq (7) for two observations made in nearby spectral bands \nis taken. Thus radiance ratios between two spectral bands in similar frequencies (Chahine, 1974; \nSmith and Platt, 1978) gives the information of cloud top pressure.     \nThe ratio of the deviations in observed radiances, R() to their corresponding clear-sky radiances, \nUTVW(Q) for two spectral bands of frequency Q\u0003 and Q\u0004 viewing the same FOV is written as \nD(Ei)\u0018DFGj(Ei)\nD(Ek)\u0018DFGj(Ek) =\nlmi ∫\nn(Ei,b)o\r[pi,q(r)]\nor\n\u000be\n\u000bh\n_b\nlmk ∫\nn(Ek,b)o\r[pk,q(r)]\nor\n\u000be\n\u000bh\n_b                              ------------------- (8) \nAs it is already stated that channels with wavenumber (or wavelength) that are very similar in  \nwavenumber (wavelength) are taken to satisfy the assumption that cloud emissivities in both \nchannels are same that is O\u0003 is approximately equal to O\u0004. With this assumption we are left with \nonly one unknown in Eq (8) and that can be easily estimated. \nAfter retrieving the value of cloud top pressure using a-priori information of  UTVW(Q) and c(Q, d) \nin eq (8), effective cloud amount or effective emissivity is computed using eq (9) \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 115 \n \nNO =\nD(E)\u0018DFGj(E)\nH[E,K(LF)]\u0018DFGj(E)                                                       ------------------- (9)  \nwhere N is the fractional cloud cover within the FOV,  NO the effective cloud amount,  is the \nwindow channel wavenumber, and P[Q, R(ST)] , is the opaque cloud radiance corresponding to \nwindow channel frequency and UTVW(Q) is the clear sky radiance corresponding to window channel. \nIt is evident from the equation (9) that effective cloud amount or effective cloud emissivity is \nmultiplication of N (fractional cloud cover within the FOV) and  (Cloud emissivity), therefore, \neffective cloud amount can be less than 1 because of:  \nbroken cloud (N<1, =1) has filled the FOV \novercast transmissive cloud (N=1, <1) \nbroken transmissive cloud (N<1, <1) \nTherefore, it is difficult to quantify exactly the emissivity of clouds using the effective cloud \namounts from approximately 50 km x 50 km INSAT-3D/3DR sounder products.  \nThe cloud top products from CO2 slicing technique are matched with other methods to filter out \nany other clouds that are not upper level clouds. Upper level clouds are flagged by using the \ncombination of highly absorbing channels (such as water vapor absorption channel in 6.7 µm or \nCO2 absorption channel in 15 µm band) and channels with less absorption. In general, the \nbrightness temperatures in strong absorption channels are much cooler than the brightness \ntemperatures (BT) in weak absorption channels for clear atmospheric condition or low level \nclouds. Contrary to this, for high level clouds BT in strong absorption channel is warmer than the \nweak absorption channels (Soden and Bretherton, 1993; Schmetz et al., 1997). Appropriate \nthresholds were taken to identify the high level clouds in INSAT-3D/3DR cloud top retrieval \nalgorithm. In present algorithm 14.03 µm (channel 3) and 13.33 µm (channel 5) of INSAT-3D/3DR \nsounder are used for this purpose. If BT of ch#3 is greater than the BT of ch#5 by a given threshold, \nthen the cloud is assumed to be high cloud and cloud top pressure from CO2 slicing method is \nretained.  \nEquation (8) is used to retrieve cloud top pressure for a 5 x 5 FOR. The left side of Equation (8) \ncontains the terms for observed radiances as well as clear radiances. The value of observed \nradiances is calculated by taking the average of cloudy pixels within 5x5 FOR. Cloud top \ncomputation is carried out only if 16 or more cloudy pixels are found within 5x5 box. Computation \nof clear sky radiances and transmittances is carried out using a fast forward radiative transfer model \ncalled RTTOV (Eyre 1991; Saunders et al. 1999; Matricardi et al 2001) developed at European \nCenter for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF). RTTOV uses the Pressure Layer \nOptical Depth algorithm (Hannon et al 1996). This model is very flexible and can take any number \nof pressure levels for forward model computation, however, internally it interpolates atmospheric \nprofiles to fixed 43 pressure levels ranging from 1013 to 0.1 hPa. This interpolation is done because \nfast forward coefficients for INSAT-3D/3DR sounder SRFs are derived on given 43 pressure \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 116 \n \nlevels. The forward calculations from RTTOV takes satellite zenith angle, absorption by well-\nmixed gases (including nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide), water vapor (including the water \nvapor continuum), and ozone into account. The forecast field from NCEP containing temperature, \nmoisture profiles, surface air temperature, skin temperature etc. are used to simulate clear sky \ntransmittances and radiances. \nThe right hand side of Equation (8) uses aforementioned transmittance profiles. Integration is \ncarried out by using trapzoidal method wherein integration limit is bounded by surface pressure \nand tropopause pressure level.    \nFor the retrieval of cloud top pressure from INSAT-3D/3DR sounder a “top-down” approach, \nsimilar to MODIS cloud top pressure retrieval method is followed. In this approach pair of two \nchannels are selected based on their decreasing opacity. If retrieval of cloud top pressure is \nsuccessful for a given pair, then there will no need for applying eq (8) for other pair of channels \nwhich are relatively less opaque. For INSAT-3D/3DR sounder first pair of ch#2 and ch#3 are taken \nwhich are considered to be the most opaque channels for CO2 slicing method. If eq (8) \nappropriately converges for this pair, then retrieval is considered to be successful, otherwise the \nsame procedure is repeated with pairs of (ch#3, ch#4) or (ch#4, ch#5). If none of these pairs are \nable to give value of cloud top pressure, then window channel method is used for retrieval of cloud \ntop pressure.   \n10.6.2. Window Channel method for cloud top pressure for low to mid clouds \nIn this method the cloud top pressure is carried out by comparing infrared window channel \nbrightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model forecast temperature profiles. A 6-h NWP \nmodel forecast from National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast \nSystem (GFS) is the source of temperature profile (GFS; Derber et al. 1991). This method assumes \nthat clouds are overcast and non-transmissive (=1). Generally, cloud top temperatures/pressure \nof low level overcast clouds are determined by using window channel method. In addition to it, \nwherein, cloud top pressure is not determined by CO2 slicing method, window channel method is \nused to retrieve cloud top properties for those pixels too. In this method cloud top pressure is \ndetermined by interpolating the cloud temperature, which is an average of BT cloudy pixels in 5x5 \nFOR, to the interpolated model guess field at the target location. The cloud emissivity is assumed \nto be unity and N=Nc/25. \nFinally, all cloudy FORs are assigned a cloud top pressure either by CO2 slicing or infrared window \ntechnique. \n10.7. Cloud top height and cloud top temperature from cloud top pressure \nThe value of cloud top height and cloud top temperature for INSAT-3D/3DR sounder are derived \ncorresponding to the retrieved cloud top pressure from INSAT-3D/3DR sounder. These values are \nagain derived using the aforementioned NCEP forecast profiles. NCEP forecast fields contains the \ntemperature and moisture profiles with pressure levels as its vertical coordinates.

Radiance bias adjustment \nIt is evident from the previous sections that cloud top properties retrieval algorithm is heavily \ndependent on quality of NCEP forecast fields and fast forward RT model. If forward simulations \nare not in consonance with observations, then there will be error in retrieved products. To make \nobservations and forward model simulations consistent, radiance bias adjustment is a necessary \nstep.  \nRadiance bias adjustment is carried out by previous eight days of good quality matchup data of \nINSAT-3D/3DR sounder clear-sky sounder observations and spatially and temporally collocated \nsimulated INSAT-3D/3DR sounder radiances. The simulation is carried out by using NCEP GFS \nanalysis and RTTOV radiative transfer model.  In this matchup data set INSAT-3D/3DR clear sky \nobservations are average over 5x5 FOR and only those FOR are selected in which more than 90% \npixels are clear. The radiance bias adjustment is done for land and ocean pixels separately. In \naddition to it, only those points are taken up for matchup data wherein satellite zenith angle is less \nthan 300. An outlier rejection method is also applied before computing radiance bias adjustment \nfactor in terms of slope and offset.    \nReferences \nAckerman, S. A., and S. K.

Introduction \nIn this document, we offer some background to the cloud microphysics retrieval over oceans using \nINSAT-3D imager data, describe the theoretical basis of the cloud microphysics retrieval \nalgorithm, discuss inputs required, output deliverables and the practical aspects of the algorithm \nimplementation, the technical issues and the future scope. \n11.3. Overview and Background \nClouds are suspension of tiny water droplets or ice crystals. They are of varying sizes and shapes. \nThey can be of water, ice or mixed phase. The size of cloud droplets is of the order of 10 µm. \nClouds strongly modulate the Earths energy balance and its atmosphere through their interaction \nwith the solar and terrestrial radiation (Roebeling et al., 2005). Their impact on the radiation budget \ncan result in a heating or cooling of the planet, depending on the radiative properties of the cloud \nand their altitude (Stephens et al., 1981). The radiative properties of the clouds depend upon the \nvarious cloud microphysical parameters which includes optical depth, effective particle radius, \nthermodynamic phase etc. Clouds interact with radiation in many ways like scattering, emission, \nabsorption and this interaction is sensitive towards each of the microphysical parameters. The \ntemporal monitoring  of cloud-top microphysics is of  extreme importance in the precipitation \ndevelopment processes. The retrieval of cloud microphysical properties like effective radius, \noptical depth, thermodynamic phase etc. from INSAT 3D has been made possible due to the \ninclusion of 1.6\u0000m channel in INSAT 3D imager.  This is a major enhancement as compared to \nthe derivation of only the cloud top temperature from Kalpana VHRR.  Earlier studies show that \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 122 \n \nthe simulation of convective systems is very sensitive to the parameterization of cloud \nmicrophysics. Thus retrieval of the microphysical parameters from INSAT 3D aids in monitoring \nand accurate prediction of convective weather events. The cloud-microphysical parameters at high \ntemporal resolution will  be very helpful in tracking the evolution of local  as well as mesoscale \nsystems.  \nThe sensitivity of different microphysical parameters to different regions of electromagnetic \nspectrum can be studied with the help of a radiative transfer (RT) model.  A Radiative transfer \nmodel (RTM) computes the radiative transfer of the electromagnetic radiation through the \natmosphere. The retrieval of cloud microphysical properties is done with the help of an RT model \nusing the imager channels of INSAT-3D. The INSAT-3D channels which may be used for cloud \nproperties retrieval includes Visible (0.65µm) and Shortwave Infrared (SWIR-1.66µm). The \nimportance of retrieving the optical thickness and effective radius derives not only from the fact \nthat such a retrieval is possible, but from the fact that shortwave cloud radiative properties depend \nalmost exclusively on these two parameters. \n11.4. Objective \nThe main objective of this document is to provide step wise algorithm, inputs and outputs as \nexpected from the INSAT-3D cloud microphysical product. This document will form the basis of \noperational implementation of the algorithm. \n11.5.

Algorithm Functional Specifications \n In this section we describe the theoretical basis and algorithm overview for deriving cloud \nmicrophysical parameters using INSAT-3D channels. \n11.6.1. Overview \nThe underlying principle on which the retrieval of these microphysical parameters is based is the \nfact that the reflection function of clouds in the visible band is primarily a function of the cloud \noptical thickness, whereas the reflection function at a water (or ice) absorbing band in the \nshortwave infrared (SWIR) is primarily a function of cloud particle size. \n11.6.2. Theoretical Background \nThe visible (0.7µm) channel is a non-absorbing channel; the reflectance depends only upon the \ncloud optical depth. Hence, there is a very significant difference between the radiances of very \nthick clouds and thin clouds in the visible spectrum. The radiance values are higher for very thick \nclouds as compared to thin clouds. This kind of behaviour indicates a pronounced effect of optical \ndepth on the visible portion of the spectrum. For the SWIR bands, the droplet absorption increases \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 124 \n \napproximately linearly with effective radius, and hence the asymptotic reflectance of a cloud \ndecreases with increasing particle size. Thus the visible band contains information primarily \nregarding cloud optical thickness, whereas the absorbing bands eventually reach an optical \nthickness where they are primarily dependent on particle size alone. A combination of visible and \nshortwave-infrared absorbing bands therefore provides information on both optical thickness and \neffective radius. \n11.6.3. Algorithm Overview \nTo retrieve the cloud optical thickness (τc) and effective particle radius (re), a radiative transfer \nmodel was first used to compute the reflected intensity field. The values of the reflection function \nwere stored for different combinations of cloud optical thickness and particle size at three \ngeometrical angles in the form of a look-up-table. The determination of optical thickness and cloud \neffective radius from spectral reflectance measurements constitutes the inverse problem. This has \nbeen solved by comparing the measured reflectances of INSAT-3D visible and SWIR channels \nwith entries in the lookup table (LUT) and searching for the combination of τc and re that gives the \nbest fit. \nIn the present case, we have used SBDART (Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative \ntransfer) radiative transfer model for computing the LUT. SBADART computes plane parallel \nradiative transfer in clear and homogeneous cloudy conditions within the Earth’s atmosphere for \nthe region from 0-50,000 st\u0018\u0003 (Ricchiazzi et al.,1998). SBDART can compute the radiative \neffects of several lower and upper atmosphere aerosol types. The radiative transfer equation is \nnumerically integrated with DISORT. This module was designed to treat the plane parallel \nradiative transfer. The discrete ordinate method provides a stable algorithm to calculate the plane \nparallel radiative transfer equation in vertically inhomogeneous atmosphere. SBDART contains \npre-computed scattering parameters for the effective radii in the 2-128μm range. In order to \ncompute the radiative transfer through the cirrus clouds, it also includes scattering parameters of \nspherical ice grains for single size distribution.  SBDART computes intensity of scattered and \nthermally emitted radiation at different heights. It allows up to 50 atmospheric layers and 20 \nradiation streams. \nThe determination of cloud optical depth and cloud effective radius from spectral reflectance \nmeasurements constitutes the inverse problem and is typically solved by comparing the measured \nreflectances with entries in a lookup table and searching for the combination of τc and re that gives \nthe best fit (Twomey and Cocks 1982, 1989). \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 125 \n \n11.6.4.

Operational retrieval implementation \nThe operational implementation of the retrieval process can be enumerated as follows: \na) Generation of random values within range of solar zenith angle (SZA), cloud optical depth, \ncloud effective radius \nb) Running of RT model for the random vectors  and  range of satellite zenith (satzen) and \nazimuth angles (satazi)  to generate LUT for visible and swir channel \nc) The input random vectors and corresponding LUT is stored. \nd) Steps (1-3) are offline processes. \ne) In online algo,  pixel wise value of swir  radiance , vis radiance,  SZA, satzen, satazi are \ntaken as input. Using land-sea mask, only oceanic geo-type pixels are chosen. \nf) A triple vector search is performed  in input fields of LUT to find closest sun –satellite \ngeometry. \ng) The corresponding  simulated radiances in  visible and swir channels is compared with \nobserved radiance from INSAT-3D for cloudy pixels  to get the best match, and \ncorresponding values of COD and CER are assigned to that pixel. \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 126 \n \n11.8.

Introduction \nThe purpose of this document is to present the methodology for deriving 5-day composite maps \nusing Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) from INSAT-3D/3DR at different broad atmospheric \nlevels. The out of six imager channels in INSAT-3D/3DR, AMVs are derived using four channels \nand they are: i) Visible (VIS) covering [0.55 – 0.75 µm], ii) Mid-wave Infrared (MIR) covering \n[3.8 – 4.0µm], iii) Water Vapor (WV) covering [6.5 – 7.1 µm] and iv) Thermal Infrared (TIR1) \ncovering [10.2 – 11.3 µm] ranges of spectrum respectively. In this document some background \nand general characteristic of different AMV-derived products; the methodology employed to \nderive the 5-day composite maps are presented.  \n12.3. Overview and background \nThe Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) derived by considering the movement of cloud and \nwater vapour tracers in successive images of geostationary satellites (Nieman et al., 1997; Velden \net al., 1997; Schmetz et al., 1993; Kishtawal et al. 2009) are considered as one of the most reliable \nsource of wind information with higher spatial-temporal coverage over the ocean as well as land \nregions.The AMVs is one of the important inputs to the global and regional assimilation systems \nfor the improvement of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). The role of AMVs is particularly \nsignificant over the oceans and high latitudes where in-situ observations are scarce. The vertical \ncoverage of AMVs spreads through high to low-levels as per the channel used during retrieval viz. \nAMV retrieved using: i) infrared channel data covers entire ranges of atmosphere i.e. from 100-\n950 hPa, ii) water vapour channel data covers only high-level i.e. from 100-500 hPa, while iii) \nvisible and mid-infrared channel data covers low-levels i.e. from 600-950 hPa respectively. 5-Day \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 131 \n \ncomposite winds maps derived using the retrieved AMVs in three broad atmospheric levels are \nvery useful for monitoring of monsoon flows over Indian region.

The region over which these products will be retrieved is \nsame as the domain where AMVs are retrieved i.e. in the region 30-130E, 50S-50N.  \n \n \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 132 \n \n12.5.

Introduction \nThe purpose of this document is to present an algorithm for retrieving High Resolution Visible \nWinds (HRVIS) from INSAT-3DR imager channel and its validation procedure. The INSAT-3DR \nwill have one visible channel (0.55 – 0.75 (m). In this document some background and general \ncharacteristic of satellite-derived winds from visible channels and INSAT-3DR visible channel \ncharacteristics; the methodology employed to derive the vector fields, theoretical basis and \npractical aspects of this algorithm and outlined the planned validation approach. \n13.2.1. Overview and background  \nSpatio–temporal analysis of meteorological events is an important part of routine numerical \nweather analysis. In that context, a cloud tracking method is presented here for a sequence of \ngeostationary satellite images. Given a pair of remotely sensed images, captured at a fixed time \ninterval (typically, 30 min), the objective is to derive motion vectors associated with the cloud \nmass. This correspondence process is a useful precursor to cloud motion vector studies and spatio–\ntemporal analysis of cloud life cycles. The spatio–temporal life cycle includes the generation, \ndissipation and assimilation of clouds that can be observed in a sequence of geostationary satellite \nimages. During the 1970’s and early 1980’s, cloud motion winds were produced in major \noperational centers like NESDIS (National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service) \nusing a combination of automated and manual techniques. Early automated techniques supplied \nquality low-level vectors from visible channels but often yielded in consistent quality for mid- and \nhigh-level motions. Height assignment for the visible winds is done with collocated infrared \nimages using infrared window technique. In the subsequent years, due to the developments in \nimage-processing and pattern recognition techniques (Merill et al., 1991), it was possible to design \nfully automatic techniques for wind retrieval, and NESDIS began its application in 1992. In later \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 136 \n \ntime, several new developments were made to make accurate retrievals of winds from satellite \nimages.   \n13.2.2. Objective \nThe main objective of this study is to derive the High Resolution Visible Winds (HRVIS) over sea \nusing multiple successive half hourly High resolution visible images. The region over which the \nwinds are derived should be in the range of 500 from sub-satellite point.  \n13.3.

Algorithm Functional Specifications \n13.4.1. Tracer selection: \nAt the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), the initial cloud \nfeatures are selected by locating the highest pixel brightness values for each target domain and \ncomputing the local gradients around those locations (Nieman et al., 1997). Any gradients greater \nthan 15° K are assigned as target locations, and prospective targets also undergo a spatial coherence \nanalysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter out unwanted targets. Water vapor tracers are \ngenerally identified using the local bi-directional gradients in a template of specified size and \ncompared with empirically determined thresholds to identify the features with sufficient variability \n(Velden et al., 1997) and those that pass the threshold value are identified as tracers for cloud-free \nenvironments. The pixel with maximum bi-directional gradient is the location of the tracer. At the \nEuropean Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the tracers \nin the Meteosat (first-generation satellites) images are selected using multispectral histogram \nanalysis (Tomassini, 1981), which extracts the dominating scenes in an image segment. Later the \nselected templates undergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter \nthe image, to enhance the upper-level cloud. In the present study the features are selected by \ncomputing local image anomaly in a 24 x 24 template window (in pixel), both in cloudy regions \nof the visible images. The local image anomaly is calculated using the following formula: \n\n\n\ni\nj\nI\nj\ni\nI\na\n)\n,\n(\n                             (1) \nWhere \nj\ni\nI ,\n represent the grey value for (i, j) pixel of a template window and bar represents the \nmean of grey values within that template. The anomaly-based tracers are generally produced by a \nsmooth feature field in comparison to the gradient-based features. This difference can help in \nreducing the tracking errors (Deb et al., 2008). \n \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 138 \n \n13.4.2. Height assignment \nThe height assignments of the selected tracers selected based on the above criterion are derived \nusing the collocated infrared images with the following widely used methods viz. such as the \ninfrared window (WIN) technique and the cloud base method (LeMarshall, 1993). Once final \nheight is selected a few gross error checks are also applied. A brief description of each method is \nfollowing: \n(a) Infrared Window Channel (WIN): \nIn this method the height assignment using a single satellite channel is made by comparing either \ninfrared window brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model forecast temperature \nprofiles. Cloud heights are determined by interpolating the cloud temperature, which is an average \nof coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess field at the target location. A 6-h NWP \nmodel forecast from National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast \nSystem (GFS) is the source of temperature profile. This method works well with opaque clouds. \nHowever, movement of opaque clouds usually does not accurately represent atmospheric motion \nat the assigned level (Nieman et al., 1993), resulting in a lower derived wind speed than observed.  \n(b) Cloud Base Method (BASE): \nWind speeds for low-level cumulus clouds (cloud top pressures greater than 600 hPa or altitudes \nlower than 600 hPa) have been found to be best represented by the movement at the cloud base \nlevel instead of the mid or upper levels of the cloud (Hasler et al., 1979). A method was developed \nat the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (LeMarshall, 1993) to estimate this height using the \nInfrared Window channel. This method first constructs a histogram of the BT values over a selected \nregion surrounding the cloud target being examined. This histogram is then smoothed and Hermite \npolynomials are fitted to the histogram to separate the distribution into two components; a cloudy \nand clear sky region. Assuming the distributions are normal, the cloud base height can be \nestimated. The mid cloud temperature is determined by examining the second derivative histogram \nof the cloudy distribution, while the cloud top temperature is estimated to be located at the coldest \n5% of the cloudy distribution. The cloud base temperature is estimated to be located the same \ndistance from the mid cloud temperature as the cloud top temperature. The calculated cloud base \ntemperature is converted to a pressure using model field interpolated to the target location. As \nmentioned previously, this height assignment method is only applied to those targets which are \ncalculated to have a cloud top pressure of greater than 600 hPa (i.e. altitude lower than 600 hPa). \nThis \"initial\" target cloud top height is provided by one of the previous Infrared Window height \nassignment methods. The BASE method is used to adjust only these winds, and is not utilized for \nwater vapor winds or winds with pressures less than 600 hPa (i.e. altitudes higher than 600 hPa).  \nOnce the visible tracers heights using the above two algorithms have been calculated, the best \nheight among the available heights is determined. The lowest pressure (highest altitude) value of \nall the calculated height values is used as the final pressure height. However, if for a specific visible \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 139 \n \ntracer final height is WIN and a valid BASE height is available, then the BASE height is used as \nthe final height. Once the final height using the above height assignment method is established, \nthe pressure height is optimized using minimized differences with first guess winds up to 75 hPa \nin upwards and downwards directions. \n13.4.3. Tracking \nIf a traceable feature is found in the first image and corresponding height of the selected tracers \nare estimated, the match of this template is searched in the second image within a bigger ‘‘search \nwindow’’, centered at the same point as the template window. To optimize the search window size, \nthe first guess model wind direction at the tracer location is also considered. The search area is \noptimized within ±30 degree from the model wind direction at that level of atmosphere. The 24 X \n24 template (in pixel) in the second image that lies within the search window should have the same \nclass as the template in the first image; otherwise the template in the second window is rejected. \nThe cross-correlation technique is used operationally for tracking the tracer between two images \nin most operational centers. However, in this study the degrees of matching between two \nsuccessive images are calculated by the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) \ncoefficient (E). It is defined as \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\ni\nt\nt\nn\ni\ns\nt\nI\nI\nI\nI\nE\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n \n \n \n(2) \nWhere \ntI and \nsI  are the variance of the grey values for template window and search window and \ntI is the average of variance of template window.  Here n is 24 x 24 (in pixel) and this is the size \nof template window and corresponding template of same size in the searching area. The size of the \nsearching area in the subsequent image is taken as 64 x 64 (in pixel). The coefficient E is \nnormalized to values between –∞ and +1. An efficiency E = 1 corresponds to a perfect match, E = \n0 means that search window is as accurate as mean of the template window and E< 0 implies the \nlack of matching between template and search window. The closer the model efficiency to 1, the \nmore accurate the matching between the windows. A cut-off value of E=0.8 is defined, below \nwhich a matching of target is not considered. The Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (E) \nis normalized and its value lies between -∞ and 1, towards the higher end (e.g. as E→ 1.0), the \nvalue of E approaches r2, where r is the correlation coefficient. Thus a value of E=1 is exactly \nequivalent to a correlation of 1.0 between two objects.  The maximum value of E is chosen as the \nbest fit for tracking. One of the main advantages of this matching technique is that it reduces the \npossibility of multiple maxima, because the parameter E has a higher sensitivity to differences \nbetween two features compared to maximum cross correlation coefficient (MCC). Thus, when the \ndegree of mismatch between two objects increases, the value of E falls more sharply compared to \nthat of MCC, making E a better index for matching two objects. The application of this tracking \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 140 \n \nmethod in estimation of water vapor winds has shown some improvement over Indian Ocean \nregion (Deb et al., 2008).   \n \n13.4.4. Wind buffer generation and Quality control \nQuality indicator of a derived wind vectors is traditionally represented as the degree of the \ncoherence of a given vector with its surrounding. In most of the operational centers the AMVs are \nderived from three successive satellite images and the quality control of the retrieved winds are \ndone either through Quality Indicator (QI) (Holmlund, 1998) followed at EUMETSAT or through \n3-dimensional recursive filter function  followed at NESDIS (Nieman et al., 1997) or both the \nalgorithms together. In the present study a new technique of wind buffer generation and \nsubsequently QI procedure followed at EUMETSAT is proposed. In this technique, a wind buffer \nis created using previous three images between a pair of images (viz. between 1-2 and 2-3) and \nstored in a file (Fig. 1).  The previous three images were considered to maintain the minimum 4-\nhour decorrelation timescale during retrieval. In quality control procedure consists of a coherence \nanalysis which forms the basis for acceptance/rejection of a vector and degree of coherence \ncomputed is used to assign quality flags to the derived vector. The value of quality flag falls sharply \nby an exponential function, as the disagreement of a given vector with its surroundings increases. \nHere each vector wind is represented by a complex number\nj\ni\nj\ni\nc\nj\ni\nv\ni\nu\nV\n,\n,\n,\n\n\n. For every new vector \nunder consideration, (from current image-pair), its vector difference from the buffer is computed \nat the same as well as 3 X 3 neighborhood (Fig. 1), provided, the vectors to be compared show \nsimilar brightness characteristics (to maintain the similar height). \n \nFig 1: A schematic diagram of quality control process. \nHere X (cross sign) at the centre of first box represents the current vector under consideration and \nO (circle sign) represents spatial and temporal neighborhood vectors. The vector differences \n(magnitude of complex numbers) are calculated as\n\n\nt\nj\ni\nc\nt\nj\ni\ndif\nV\nV\nV\n,\n,\n,\n,\n\n\n.

If all spatial and temporal neighborhood vectors are present, \nthen the difference set will contain 27 vectors (9 spatial neighborhoods with 3 temporal scales). \nHowever, all vectors may not be there all the times. The quality control process begins if at least \n10 vector differences\ndif\nV\n, excluding the difference corresponding to current (i, j), are present in \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 141 \n \nthe set. In the next step, set of vector differences \n\ndif\nV\n is arranged in ascending order. The quality \ncontrol process begins is the average of 10 \ndif\nV\n is greater than 2.5 m/s. In the next step, the QI \nvalue for each vector is determined by using EUMETSAT procedure where four different tests are \nperformed, which is normalized by a tanh-function that returns the value between 0 and 1. A \nweighted average of these individual quality indicators is then used for screening of poor quality \nvectors from final output. If any vector is not present in the immediate two pairs, then in-stead of \nrejecting, search process goes to the previous time steps of the wind buffer and if still it is not \npresent it goes to next previous times steps and so on. \nIf S is the mean “speed” of a vector computed from two pair of images, then different quality \nfunctions are computed as below: \n \nDirection Consistency Function: \n1\n)\n)\n/\nexp(\ntanh(\n0.1\n1\n1\n1\nD\nC\nB\nS\nA\nDCF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSpeed Consistency Function: \n2\n)\n)\n,\n(\ntanh(\n0.1\n2\n2\n2\nD\nC\nB\nS\nA\nMAX\nS\nSCF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n  Vector Consistency Function: \n3\n)\n)\n,\n(\ntanh(\n0.1\n3\n3\n3\nD\nC\nB\nS\nA\nMAX\nV\nVCF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSpacial Consistency Function: \n4\n)\n)\n,\n(\ntanh(\n0.1\n2\n4\n4\nD\nm\nC\nB\nS\nA\nMAX\nV\nPCF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn the above formulation, \nV\nS \n\n\n,\n,\n\nrepresent the difference of direction (degrees), difference of \nspeed, and the length of the difference vector between first and second satellite wind component. \nm\nV\n\n is the length of difference vector between satellite wind component and its best neighbor. \nThe best neighbor is determined by the smallest vector difference.

Hundreds of \n“isolated” vectors thus get eliminated, even though they represent the real situation. In the current \nmethod, the vector under consideration receives support from the past eight images. This method \nproduces higher number of valid retrieval in the low-level and captures upper-level meridional \nflow very prominently. To explain this more explicitly, if we take three satellite images each with \n30-minute interval stating at 02:30 UTC to 03:30 UTC, then winds retrieved using each-image pair \nare stored as buffer in a file and represented as wind buffer generated at 03:30 UTC. The buffer \ngenerated at 03:30 UTC is used for quality control for wind retrieved using 03:30 UTC and 04:00 \nUTC images and the second image time is given as actual observation time of retrieved wind. For \nexample, winds retrieved using 03:30 UTC wind buffer and 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images is \ngiven as 04:00 UTC observation time. As a whole to complete the process once it requires four \nimages. Similarly, the buffer is updated at every 30-minute with the latest available image and \nprocess is repeated for next cycle of wind retrieval. This method produces higher number of valid \nretrieval in all levels and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. \n13.5.

The selection of three \nimages is consistent with decorrelation timescales of winds over tropical region. \n Use quality control criteria for selecting wind using the wind buffer. \n Calculate wind speed and direction. \n13.6.

This should be done for three latitude bands: north of 20 N, the \ntropical belt (20 N to 20 S), and south of 20 S. \nii) Trends of the evaluation statistics for the monthly cloud motion vectors and water vapor motion \nvectors through the last 12 months.   \n iii) Information on recent significant changes in the wind retrieval algorithm. \nThe vector Difference (VD) between an individual wind report (i) and the collocated radiosonde \nreport used for verification is given by \nPara\nmeter \nLat \nLon. \nLevel \nU-\ncomp\nonent \nV-\ncomp\nonent \nQuality \nFlag \nWind \nSpeed \n(m/s) \nWind \ndirection \n(clockwise \nfrom North) \nWind \nzenith \nangle \nUnit \nN \nE \nhPa \nm/s \nm/s \n0.0 to \n0.9  \nm/s \nDeg \nDeg \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 145 \n \n(uv) = [(wx  − wW)\u0004 + (ux  − uW)\u0004]\n\u0003\n\u0004 \nThe speed bias is given by \n(Pyz{)x = 1\nN |[(wx\n\u0004  + ux\n\u0004)\n\u0003\n\u0004  − (wW\n\u0004 + uW\n\u0004)\n\u0003\n\u0004]\nl\nx}\u0003\n \nThe mean vector difference (MVD) traditionally reported is \n(~uv) = 1\nN |(uv)x\nl\nx}\u0003\n \nAnd the standard deviation (SD) about the mean vector difference traditionally reported is \n({v) = [1\nN |((uv)x  −(~uv))\u0004\nl\nx}\u0003\n]\n\u0003\n\u0004 \nThe root-mean-square error (RMSE) traditionally reported is the square root of the sum of the \nsquares of the mean vector difference and the standard deviation about the mean vector difference, \n(U~{) = [(~uv)\u0004 + ({v)\u0004]\n\u0003\n\u0004 \nIt must be noted that this definition of the mean vector difference is not the same as the mean \ncomponent difference.  The mean difference is calculated from the sum of the squares of the \ndeviations of each component (u and v) of the wind vector. \n(∆w\u0004) = |(wx  − wW)\u0004\nl\nx}\u0003\n \n(∆u\u0004) = |(ux  − uW)\u0004\nl\nx}\u0003\n \nTo avoid confusion, a common terminology will be accepted. It is suggested to report mean vector \ndifference (MVD) and standard deviation (SD). The standard accuracy according to CGMS \nguideline for CMV is that the root mean square error (RMSE) for WV winds should be 7m/s \nrespectively with respect to radiosonde observations. The mean bias for both sets of winds should \nbe about zero. \n13.8. Technical Issues (Limitations etc.) \nAccuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the registration of the images. If the \nregistration has an error of 1 pixel, then error of the final product will be increased. However, the \nfollowing limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind.However, the retrieved vectors \nin regions are lacking in defining moisture structure, though they have the ability to obtain track-\nable information in extremely dry air masses and regions of strong subsidence is limited. The \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 146 \n \nindividual vectors represent single level reports; however, upper level vertical winds profiles are \npossible by using multi-spectral observations. \na) Sensitivity of error in height assignment to the error in wind speed retrieval \nThis sensitivity will depend upon the structure of wind circulation over different vertical levels as \nwell as different geographical regions. For example, in the vicinity of atmospheric jets, the \nretrieved wind vectors will be highly sensitive to the errors in the assigned pressure levels. Based \non some standard analysis (e.g. NCEP reanalysis of 6-hourly sampling), we will provide a \nquantitative assessment of the vertical and spatial structure of this sensitivity. \nb) Numerical model to be used for AMV height assignment \nWe plan to use IMD’s operational regional model output during height assignment procedure. \nHowever, if the domain of this regional model is smaller than the area of AMV retrieval, either \nIMD may be requested to increase the domain of its operational model, or a lower-quality solution \nbased on the output of coarser-resolution GCM will be generated over the regions not covered by \nIMD’s regional model. \nc) Whether RT model to be used in real-time for height assignment   \nTo use RT model in real-time height-assignment application is generally required to find the \noptimum solution. However, it is computationally expensive and may increase the AMV turn-\naround time very significantly. Efforts are currently underway to develop an empirical version of \nRT model that can be used for simulation of IR and water-vapor channel radiances for a variety of \ncloud heights. The inverse of this empirical model will then be used in real-time applications.  \n \nd) Comparison of maximum-correlation and minimum-difference methods for tracking of \ncloud-tracers. \nThe comparison has been made for a large number of image samples and it was found that the \nefficiencies of minimum-difference method (MDM) and maximum cross correlation (MCC) \nmethods are comparable, while the MDM method is significantly faster than MCC. \n \nReferences \nBedka KM, Mecikalski JR (2005) Application of satellite-derived atmospheric motion vectors for \nestimating meso-scale flows.

Introduction \nThe geostationary satellite derived winds, also known as Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) are \nconsidered as one of the most reliable source of wind information over oceanic region where \nnormal ground based observations are very rare. Presently in India operationally AMVs are \navailable from two advanced meteorological satellites INSAT-3D (Deb et al., 2016, Kishtawal et \nal., 2009) and INSAT-3DR using consecutive 30-minutes images (www.mosdac.gov.in). It is also \nwell established that assimilation of AMVs in the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model \nleads to significant improvement in the weather forecast (Deb et al, 2010; Kaur et al., 2015; Kumar \net al. 2016) over the Indian Ocean region. The purpose of this document is to present an algorithm \nfor retrieving Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) from INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR in \nstaggering mode and its validation procedure. The INSAT-3D/3DR have two IR window channels \n(10.5-11.5μ and 11.5-12.5 μ). In this document some background and general characteristic of \nsatellite-derived AMV and INSAT-3D/3DR IR channel characteristics; the methodology employed \nto derive the vector fields, theoretical basis and practical aspects of this algorithm and outlined the \nplanned validation approach. \n14.2.1. Overview and background  \nThe availability of data from both INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR with similar spectral characteristic \nand region of interest, at every 15-minutes has motivated us to re-look further for the improvement \nin retrieval algorithm to get better quality AMVs over the Indian Ocean region. The specific reason \nfor this motivation is that in stead of using 30-minute images for winds retrieval, the accuracy of \nwinds will improve if shorter spatio-temporal images are used during the retrieval. For example, \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 151 \n \nif INSAT-3D captured image at 0000 UTC, then INSAT-3DR does at 0015 UTC and similar \nnomenclature follows for other time of the day. The operational meteorological parameters derived \nusing INSAT-3DR are same as that of INSAT-3D, with 15 minute time gap. In both the satellites, \nspectrum of the atmosphere is covered by six imager channels i.e. the Visible (VIS), Short-wave \ninfrared (SWIR), Mid-wave infrared (MIR), Water vapor (WV) and two split window thermal \ninfrared (TIR1 and TIR2) channels. The image registration accuracy significantly improved \nbecause of star sensors are present on both the satellites. The individual INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR \nAMVs are derived every 30-minute intervals. As an example, the INSAT-3D AMVs are retrieved \nat 0000, 0030, 0100 UTC, while INSAT-3DR AMVs are derived at 0015, 0045, 0115 UTC \nrespectively. The AMV derived from these satellites are widely accepted by different national and \ninternational operational agencies. In the present study, the algorithm for deriving AMVs using \ninfrared and water vapor images from INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR data in staggering mode is \ndemonstrated. Subsequently, this new AMVs generated using staggering mode will bee inter-\ncompared with individually retrieved INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR AMVs.  \n14.2.2. Objective \nThe availability of data from both INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR with similar spectral characteristic \nand region of interest, at every 15-minutes has motivated to re-look further for the improvement \nin retrieval algorithm to get better quality AMVs over the Indian Ocean region. The specific reason \nfor this motivation is that in stead of using 30-minute images for winds retrieval, the accuracy of \nwinds will improve if shorter spatio-temporal images are used during the retrieval. The main \nobjective of this study is to derive the algorithm for retrieving AMVs using infrared and water \nvapor images from INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR data in staggering mode.   \n14.3.

Algorithm Functional Specifications \n14.4.1. Methodology \nThe operationally four different spectral channels of INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR are used to derive \nAMVs over the Indian Ocean region and operational retrieval algorithm is described in Deb et al. \n2016. In the present document, a new staggering algorithm is discussed where data from infrared \n(i.e. TIR1) and water vapor (i.e. WV) channels of both the satellites are used simultaneously for \nhigher temporal scale retrieval. Although the major steps of retrieval algorithm (i.e. Tracer \nParameter \nRes. \nAccuracy \nSource \nRegistered radiometric and geometric \ncorrected gray count values of split \nwindow TIR1 channel (10.5-11.5 μm) \nand WV channel (6.7μm) \n(All the data is required in fixed lat-\nlon grid for continuous 8-images \nseparated by 30 minutes time interval \nfor each satellite) \nL1C- Sector generated images over \ncommon area.  \nIt is assumed here that all input \nimages \n(both \nINSAT-3D \nand \nINSAT-3DR) are well registered. \npixel \n-- \nDerived from raw \ndata by DP (data \nrocessing) \nGray value to brightness temperature \nconversion table \n- \n0.3 K \nDerived by DP \nGeo-location file \nPixel \n4 km \nDerived by DP \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 153 \n \nselection, height assignment, tracking and quality control etc) staggering algorithm is same as \npresent operational algorithm, however a few changes incorporated in the new algorithm to \nminimize the inaccuracies due to two separate satellite platform is shown in the following Figure \n-1.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1: The flowcharts of staggering AMVs retrieval algorithm using INSAT-3D/3DR data \n \nAt first, the satellite ID from which first input image is coming is checked, if it is from INSAT-\n3DR, then second image from INSAT-3D is read. In the first image possible cloud tracers are \nidentified and each selected tracer is represented by a box of 32 x 32 pixel. The tracer box in the \nfirst image (i.e. INSAT-3DR) is calibrated with respect to the collocated box in second image (i.e. \nINSAT-3D) using the following formula: \n \n\n\n2\n1\n2\n1\n1\n1\n)\nvar(\n)\nvar(\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\n\n\n.\n \nHere, I1 and I2 represent the 32 x 32 (in pixel) tracer boxes from first and second image \nrespectively. Var(I1) and Var(I2) represent the variance of the tracer boxes. This is performed to \nreduce the uncertainty in inter-calibration of two different satellites, all-though their sensor \nspecifications are exactly same. Then cloud tracers are selected by local image anomaly technique \nin a particular image and subsequently height of the selected tracers is calculated. The height \nassignment component of operational AMV retrieval algorithm uses widely used traditional \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 154 \n \nmethods viz. the infrared window (WIN) technique, the H2O intercept method (Nieman et al., \n1993) and the cloud base method (LeMarshall et. al., 1993). Then selected tracers are tracked in \nlarger window in the subsequent image by using the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency [Nash and \nSutcliffe, 1970] coefficient. The detailed description of each step is already discussed in the \nAlgorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) of infrared and water vapor winds from INSAT-\n3D or INSAT-3DR (Deb et al. 2008)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2: A sample flow-diagram of methodology for the retrieval of AMVs in staggering mode for a \nparticular time 0500 UTC. \n \nIf the selected first image is from INSAT-3D, the tracers are selected and height assignment is done, \nthen before tracking the selected tracers in the second INSAT-3DR image, collocated tracer box in \nINSAT-3DR is calibrated to INSAT-3D equivalent. The process of tracer selection, height \nassignment and tracking is repeated for sixteen pair of images to generate sixteen pairs of raw \nwinds which is called as wind buffer. Later, this wind buffer is used for quality control of AMVs. \nDuring the quality control, temporal, spatial consistency checks are performed with neighboring \nvectors extracted from the wind buffer. A sample flow-diagram of methodology for the retrieval \nof staggering AMVs at 0500 UTC is shown in Figure-2. To derive winds valid at 0500 UTC \nrequires total seventeen images of 15-minute interval viz. nine images from INSAT-3D starting \nfrom 0100 UTC and eight images from INSAT-3DR starting from 0115 UTC. In the next steps \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 155 \n \nwind buffer is calculated using sixteen wind pairs. In the following step quality control technique \nis applied to wind buffer to estimate the final output valid at 0500 UTC.  \n14.4.2. Operational Implementation \nStep 1 : Conversion from gray count to BT \n \nSince accuracy of the wind is dependent on image registration and it is assumed here that \nall input images are well registered. The details algorithm for registration is defined in the \ndata product document as provided by DP team. In this step a radiation model will be \nused to convert the instrument measured radiance into brightness temperature. This \nrequires an accurate definition of the spectral response of the satellite.  \nStep 2: Tracer selection from image \n Read first two registered images from INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR.  \n Choose the tracer box in the first image (i.e. 3D) and calibrate the similar tracer box from \n3DR from second image into 3D equivalent.  \n Cloud tracer selection will be done by evaluating the maximum local gradients \nsurrounding each pixel in the target array and selecting the maximum brightness \ntemperature of the window.    \nStep 3: Height assignment \n For height assignment use brightness temperature from single satellite (i.e either 3D or \n3DR) to avoid height inaccuracies due to inter-calibration of two satellites.  \n Assign height of the tracer using IR window technique. In this case the brightness \ntemperature in the target window will be averaged and matched with collocated numerical \nmodel temperature profile. The level of optimum fit will be assigned as initial height. \n Re-assign the height using H2O intercept technique for semi-transparent tracers. \n Re-assign the height using cloud-base height assignment technique. \n Assign correct height after implementing all the height assignment technique mentioned \nabove. \n Height optimization using minimized differences with first guess. \nStep 4: Tracking \n \nBefore tracking the tracer selected from first image in the second image, bigger tracking \narea in the second image is calibrated with respect to the first image. \n \nThe tracking employs a simple search for the mean absolute difference of the radiance \ndifference between the target and search arrays in subsequent half hourly images. This \nsearch will be done in the direction of 30o of model wind. \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 156 \n \nStep 5: Wind buffer generation & quality control \n The wind buffer is created using previous eight images between pairs of images (viz. the \nwinds retrieved between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored in a file.  The \nselection of eight images is consistent with decorrelation timescales of winds over tropical \nregion. \n Use quality control criteria for selecting wind using the wind buffer. \n Use EUMETSAT automatic quality control method to get the QI \n \nCalculate wind speed and direction.       \n14.5.

Information on recent significant changes in the wind retrieval algorithm. \nThe vector Difference (VD) between an individual wind report (i) and the collocated radiosonde \nreport used for verification is given by  \n                      (VD)  =   [ (Ui – Ur)2  +  (Vi – Vr)2 ]1/2 \nThe speed bias is given by \nThe mean vector difference (MVD) traditionally reported is   \n                           N \n(BIAS)i  =  1/N ∑  [( Ui2   +  V i2 )1/2   -  (Ur2   +  Vr2 )1/2  ] \n                          i=1 \n                        N \n(MVD)  = 1/N ∑ (VD)i         \n                        i=1                \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 158 \n \nAnd the standard deviation (SD) about the mean vector difference traditionally reported is  \n                                          N          \n                  (SD)  =  [1/N  ∑ ( (VDi) – (MVD) )2 ]1/2 \n                                   i=1            \nThe root-mean-square error (RMSE) traditionally reported is the square root of the sum of the \nsquares of the mean vector difference and the standard deviation about the mean vector difference, \n                          (RMSE) = [(MVD)2  +  (SD)2  ]1/2 \nIt must be noted that this definition of the mean vector difference is not the same as the mean \ncomponent difference.  The mean difference is calculated from the sum of the squares of the \ndeviations of each component (u and v) of the wind vector. \nTo avoid confusion, a common terminology will be accepted.  It is suggested to report mean vector \ndifference (MVD) and standard deviation (SD). The standard accuracy according to CGMS \nguideline for CMV is that the root mean square error (RMSE) for WV winds should be 7m/s \nrespectively with respect to radiosonde observations.  The mean bias for both sets of winds should \nbe about zero. \n14.7. Technical Issues (Limitations etc) \nAccuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the registration of the images. If the \nregistration has an error of 1 pixel, then error of the final product will be increased. However the \nfollowing limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind. The spatially coherent, high \nresolution coverage of upper tropospheric winds are possible from geostationary satellite remote \nsensing of water vapor. CMV are comparable in quality to operational upper-level cloud-motion \nvectors. However, the retrieved vectors in regions are lacking in defining moisture structure, \nthough they have the ability to obtain track-able information in extremely dry air masses and \nregions of strong subsidence is limited. The individual vectors represent single level reports; \nhowever, upper level vertical winds profiles are possible by using multi-spectral observations. \na. Sensitivity of error in height assignment to the error in wind speed retrieval \n \n    N \n(∆U2)  =  ∑ (Ui –Ur)2   \n               i=1 \n \n               N \n(∆V2)  =  ∑ (Vi –Vr)2   \n               i=1 \n \n(MCD) =   [ (∆U2)  + (∆V2)  ]1/2  ≠ (MVD) \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 159 \n \nThis sensitivity will depend upon the structure of wind circulation over different vertical levels as \nwell as different geographical regions. For example, in the vicinity of atmospheric jets, the \nretrieved wind vectors will be highly sensitive to the errors in the assigned pressure levels. Based \non some standard analysis ( e.g. NCEP reanalysis of 6-hourly sampling), we will provide a \nquantitative assessment of the vertical and spatial structure of this sensitivity. \nb. Numerical model to be used for AMV height assignment \nWe plan to use IMD’s operational regional model output during height assignment procedure. \nHowever, if the domain of this regional model is smaller than the area of AMV retrieval, either \nIMD may be requested to increase the domain of its operational model, or a lower-quality solution \nbased on the output of coarser-resolution GCM will be generated over the regions not covered by \nIMD’s regional model. \nc. Whether RT model to be used in real-time for height assignment   \nTo use RT model in real-time height-assignment application is generally required to find the \noptimum solution. However, it is computationally expensive and may increase the AMV turn-\naround time very significantly. Efforts are currently underway to develop an empirical version of \nRT model that can be used for simulation of IR and water-vapor channel radiances for a variety of \ncloud heights. The inverse of this empirical model will then be used in real-time applications.  \n \nd. Comparison of maximum-correlation and minimum-difference methods for tracking of \ncloud-tracers. \nThe comparison have been made for a large number of image samples and it was found that the \nefficiencies of minimum-difference method (MDM) and maximum cross correlation (MCC) \nmethods are comparable, while the MDM method is significantly faster than MCC.    \n \nReferences \nDeb, S.K., C.M.

INTRODUCTION \nWeather and climate affects many sectors of the human activity as well as many aspects of the \nworld's natural ecosystems. The hydrological cycle is one of the important components of Weather \nand climate system. The hydrological cycle describes the exchange of water substance between \nsea, air, soil, rock, plants and animals. The precipitation and evaporation processes significantly \naffect the global hydrological cycle. The quantitative assessment of precipitation is needed to \nimprove understanding of the behavior of global energy and circulation patterns as well as the \nnature of climate variability. The choice of measured parameter has been influenced by the cost of \ninstallation, operation, longevity and temporal as well as spatial coverage of the instruments. The \nland based techniques of rainfall estimation are not sufficient for global rainfall assessment as \nabout 70% of the Earth is covered with water. The space borne measurement and monitoring of \nrainfall is, therefore, a topic of major interest since they provide global coverage both on land and \nocean for an extended period of time. A longstanding promise of meteorological satellites is the \nimproved identification and quantification of precipitation at time scales consistent with the nature \nand development of precipitation processes. Meteorological satellites expand the coverage and \ntime span of conventional ground-based rainfall data for a number of applications. The primary \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 163 \n \nscope of satellite rainfall monitoring is to provide information on rainfall occurrence, amount and \ndistribution over the regional to continental scales. The uneven distribution of rain gauges and \nweather radars and the relative lack of rainfall measurements over the oceans have significantly \nlimited the use of global as well local data. Precipitation is one of the most variable quantities in \nspace and time. Precipitation also has a direct impact on human life that other atmospheric \nphenomena seldom have: an example is represented by heavy rain events and flash floods (Barrett \nand Michell, 1991). Geostationary weather satellite visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) imagers provide \nthe rapid temporal update cycle needed to capture the growth and decay of precipitating clouds. \nMicrowaves provide the interaction of radiation with hydrometeors but with coarser resolution and \nlimited swath widths of satellites with in tropical orbit such as the Tropical Rainfall Measuring \nMission (TRMM) (Kummerow et al., 1998) and of sensors in polar orbits like the Special Sensor \nMicrowave Imager (SSM/I) series.  \n15.2.1 Overview  \nOperational applications, require quantitative rainfall determination from a variety of precipitating \nsystems, which differ both dynamically and microphysically. This fact prompts for non-unique \nsolutions based on the physics of precipitation formation processes. Barrett and Martin (1981) and \nKidder and Vonder Haar (1995) give excellent reviews of the available methods. Petty (1995) has \nexamined the status of satellite rainfall estimation over land. Recent reviews Levizzani et al. (2001) \nhas covered results and future perspectives from the geostationary orbit. The perspective varies \nwidely from the relatively simple methods used for climatic-scale analyses (e.g. Arkin and \nArdanuy, 1989; Arkin and Janowiak, 1991) to the more elaborate instantaneous rainrate \nestimations for research and nowcasting (Ba and Gruber, 2001; Turk et al., 2000; Vicente et al., \n1998). \nRecent technological developments of MW instruments on board polar orbiters have been dramatic \nbut the use of VIS, IR and water vapor (WV) channels of geostationary satellites is still \nindispensable. In particular, the launch of the newest generation of geostationary satellites, the \nGeostationary Operational Environmental Satellite GOES-I-M series (Menzel and Purdom,1994) \nand the upcoming METEOSAT Second Generation (MSG) (Schmetz et al., 2002) with its Spinning \nEnhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), adds new channels to the traditional VIS/IR/WV \ntriplet. Some of the new channels have been tested for decades as part of the Advanced Very High \nResolution Radiometer (AVHRR) series on board the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration (NOAA) polar orbiters or have other heritages.  \nMultispectral data have long since been available both from polar orbiting and geostationary \nsatellite sensors and used for retrieving cloud properties. The relevant channels for cloud \ncharacterization were part of the payload of the polar satellites, while the sensors at \ngeosynchronous altitude were almost exclusively devoted to VIS-IR operational monitoring of \nprecipitation system displacements. This has considerably changed in the past few years since \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 164 \n \nmore and more sophisticated sensors have been conceived for the GEO orbits that will allow for \nglobal real-time cloud characterization.  \nCloud radiative properties at VIS, near IR (NIR) and IR wavelengths have long since been studied \nand documented (among others Arking and Childs, 1985; Cheng et al., 1993, Saunders and Kriebel, \n1988; Slingo and Schrecker, 1982). In the thermal IR the radiative properties are sensitive to the \nsize distribution of the hydrometeors. In particular, an increase in the particle size increases the \ntransmissivity, decreasing the reflectivity and increasing the emissivity of the cloud layer. This \nlatter dominates at these wavelengths. In the NIR (e.g. the 3.9 mm MSG channel) the emissivity \nof a cloud layer is lower than in the thermal IR window: there is a large contribution of reflected \nradiation at the cloud top. Clouds with small hydrometeors scatter and reflect much of the 3.9 mm \nradiance. An increase in cloud particle size or the presence of large drops or ice crystals near the \ncloud top reduces the 3.9 mm reflectance from the cloud. containing more ice reflect less solar \nradiation in the 3.7 - 3.9 mm range as ice strongly absorbs at these wavelengths and ice crystals \nare generally larger than cloud droplets at cloud top. NIR reflectance mostly refers to cloud \nparticles effective radius (re).VIS reflectance is primarily due to cloud optical depth. \nSeveral methods have been proposed for the retrieval of cloud parameters from various cloud \ntypes. Pioneering studies were conducted by Arking and Childs (1985) and Nakajima and King \n(1990). Water Vapor images show the presence of water in the gas form between 22,000 and 35,000 \nfeet above the earth's surface. The brighter white color indicates areas of moisture. Black depicts \nneutral. Lensky and Rosenfeld (1997) have conceived a multispectral rainfall estimation technique \nbased on the method of Rosenfeld and Gutman (1994). They concentrated on areas of around 2000 \nkm2 that Rosenfeld and Gagin (1989) showed to be the critical limit beyond which a further \nincrease in cloud cluster area does not result in higher rain rates.  \nIR and NIR channels other than the thermal IR window show some potential for application to \nrainfall estimations. Techniques for the instantaneous delineation of convective rainfall areas using \nsplit window data were initially conceived for the NOAA AVHRR (Inoue, 1987a,b, 1997) and are \ninstrumental for the detection of semi-transparent cirrus clouds (Inoue, 1985). These techniques \nrely upon the detection of non-precipitating cirrus and low-level cumulus clouds using the two \nwindow channels at 10.5 - 11.5 and 11.5 - 12.5 µm (the so-called split window). The information \ncontent of the split window channels partially corrects erroneous rainfall area delineation (and \nconsequent frequent rainfall overestimate) of simple IR techniques producing better false alarm \nratios (FAR). The NIR 3.9 µm channel of GOES-8/9 satellites includes spectral features suitable \nfor applications to rainfall detection and estimation. This channel was included for a long time in \nNOAA/AVHRR instruments (centered at 3.7 µm) for a variety of purposes including ice \ndiscrimination and sun-glint detection. Vicente (1996) developed a simple and fast algorithm for \nrainfall retrieval using the 11 and 3.9 µm channels with the obvious advantage of nighttime use \nand sensitivity to the presence of ice and water vapor.  \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 165 \n \nIn the present ATBD document the description of the scientific algorithms which will be developed \nand used to estimate rainfall from two of the standard operational algorithms of NOAA from the \ndata acquired by the Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR ) onboard INSAT-3D satellite. \nVHRR produces images in six spectral channels, in the Visible (VIS), Near Infra-red (NIR), Mid \nWave Infra-Red (MWIR),  and Infra-Red (IR) part of the spectrum covering the following \nchannels: VIS 0.6μm,  NIR 1.6μm, MWIR 3.9μm, WV 6.7μm,   IR 10.8μm, IR 12.0μm . Each \nchannel of the Imager has different resolution as mentioned in the Table-1 in sections ahead. \n15.2.2. Objectives \nThere are two main objectives under the rainfall retrieval algorithms from INSAT-3D.. These \ntechniques are now known as GOES Precipitation Index (GPI) and INSAT Multispectral Rainfall \nAlgorithm Technique (IMSRA). Both the algorithms are state of art and aimed at estimation of \nrainfall with different applications at different spatial and temporal requirements respectively. First \nGPI related objectives are the implementation of the algorithm following Arkin (1979), while the \nsecond one is related to the development of the algorithm named GMSRA following Ba and Gruber \n(2001). Originally the GPI technique has been in operation for a large scale rainfall estimation by \nNational community for more than two decades. The IMSRA on the other hand is a new one and \nis developed  \nThe inherent limitations of optical channels remains persistent for rainfall retrieval as the rainfall \nin the ground is inferred by cloud top signatures only. There is no direct physical connection \nbetween the rain/cloud and ice hydrometeors within the clouds with radiance emanating from \ncloud tops to the sensor. The accuracy of rainfall estimate is improves only marginally even with \nsignificant new efforts. However, the high spatial and temporal coverage of Geostationary optical \nmeasurements is the very strong point along with the resolution capabilities of the sensors. At the \nsame time microwaves have a direct physical connections with vertical structure of rainfall and \nthus with the cloud, rain and ice hydrometeors. But the non-portability of microwave sensors to \nthe geostationary platforms till date due to technological constraints is a limitation and thus only \nlow earth orbiting satellites can provide the rainfall information of land, ocean and atmosphere as \non now. With the advent of active and passive radar and radiometric sensors onboard a single \nsatellite (e.g. Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission-TRMM) we envisaged that a technique like \nGMSRA can be further improved for Indian tropical regions and more reliable rainfall information \ncan be retrieved. We henceforth call this technique as INSAT Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm \n(IMSRA), as a specific technique for Indian Tropical regions. Our objectives for both the \ntechniques (GPI and IMSRA) here are based on these premises and are outlined below (mainly in \ncases of IMSRA). \nA1. INSAT-3D Rainfall using  GPI Method: \n1.  To generate  a total day rainfall maps using 3 hourly brightness temperatures of IR (11 um) \nimages for 1.0 x 1.0 deg  latitude /longitude boxes in an area -500 to +500 lat and 300E to 1300E \nusing Arkin’s GPI method. \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 166 \n \n2. To generate mean spatial variance and histogram of 24 classes of temperatures at 1.0 x 1.0 deg  \nlatitude/longitude. \n 3. To derive QPE based on  daily basis following the 3 hourly data of IR observations (8 images \na day). \n 4. Validation of rainfall products using rain gauges and Doppler Weather Radar data. \n 5 . Inter-satellite comparison using other contemporary satellites like Meteosat, NOAA etc.  \n 6. Estimation of rainfall on pentad, monthly mean, seasonal mean and annual mean scales after \ndue calibration/validation from radar and inter-satellite comparisons as above, rainfall. \nA2. To Develop Precipitation Estimates Using the Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA) \nTechnique: \nThe relation between precipitation amount and cloud fraction as seen from satellite passive \nradiometers in case of GPI technique above, though simple and straightforward it might seem, has \nnot yet reached completely satisfactory accuracy, effectiveness, and time/space coverage. There \nare numerous applications in meteorology and hydrology where accurate information at scales \nsmaller than the existing  1.0  products (e.g. daily or sub daily estimates at resolutions of 1  and \ndown to the 0.10 0 and pixel scales) would be invaluable. There is also increasing demand from \nthe meteorology and climate community for such products over extended periods. High-resolution \nrainfall information is available for limited areas using combinations of ground-based radar and \ndense networks of rain gauges. In India in particular, where the need of high spatial and temporal \nrainfall is essential, for large and varied areas of India (Western Ghats, plateaus, Himalayan \nRegions, North-Eastern Regions, Arid and Semi-Arid Zones) however, the in-situ infrastructure \nnecessary for this form of precipitation monitoring network is not in place.  Recent developments \nmostly refer to microwave (MW) sensors on board polar orbiters, but the use of visible (VIS) and \ninfrared (IR) sensors of geostationary satellites for a variety of applications is by no means over. \nThus a suit of both supplementing each others would be the ideal situation, particularly when the \nhighly advanced microwave sensors data from various international satellites are available on near \nreal time basis.   \nThe main objectives here in IMSRA algorithm are to estimate rainfall by developing a \nMultispectral Rainfall Algorithm which is an optimal combination of GMSRA and some of the \ninnovative proposed approaches that utilizes microwave remote sensing measurements from polar \norbiting satellites. Here, the rainfall algorithm is with more advantageous that combines satellite \npassive microwave and infrared (IR) data to account for limitations in both data types. Rainfall \nestimates are produced at the high spatial resolution and temporal frequency of the IR data using \nrainfall information from the PMW data. Over the last few years, a number of groups world wide \nhave embarked on development of such techniques wherein the advantages of geosynchronous \nviz.  vast  coverage   and  near  sufficient  space-time  sampling,  and  polar  passive  microwave \nradiometers  viz.  more  physically  based retrievals,  are  synergistically  used  to \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 167 \n \ngenerate    tropical  rainfall  on  various  scales (e.g. Adler et al. 1994, Todd et al. 2001, Gairola \nand Krishnamurti 1992). With above background the objectives for Multi Spectral Rainfall \nAlgorithm (IMSRA) are as follows. \nThe technique has the  following components: \n1. Identify  areas for very deep convective cores from IR and WV channels ( 11m-6.7m), \nwhich corresponds  well with rainfall. \n2. To screen mid-to upper level clouds with or without thin cirrus above the rain and non-rain \nbaring clouds. \n3. Cloud growth classification based  on temporal gradients  of TIR – TB’s. \n4. Filtering of low and non raining clouds along with the warm and semi-transperent clouds \nbased on IR and WV  when rainfall is estimated for clouds having brightness temperatures \ncolder than 240K. \n5. Spatial and temporal co-location of INSAT-TIR brightness temperature, and TRMM / \nSSM/I rainfall for creation of matched database. \n6. To compute instantaneous rain rate using pre-calibrated rain rate for cloud top brightness \ntemperature (11 m) for each pixel classified as containing raining clouds along with \nSatellite Microwave Radiometric measurements (e.g TRMM Microwave Imager-TMI). \n7. The global bias correction based on a polynomial model of the suitable form designed on \nthe basis of comparison with TRMM-3B42 daily average rain (June and July). \n8. The orographic correction is based on the climatological ratio bias between IMSRA and \nTRMM-3B42 for the orographic regions (Mahesh et al., 2014). \n9. Cloud growth/decay correction based on the study of Mahesh et al., 2014 and Woodley , \nSancho and Vicente (1972) \n10.

The rainfall from those DWRs, which will be well \ncalibrated using an appropriate site specific Z-R relationship over Indian regional sites of the \nrespective radar locations will be used for validation. In some cases one hourly rainfall from fast \nresponse rain gauges would be highly desirable particularly the areas where the DWR coverage is \nnot at all there. Thus 1 to 3 hourly gauge-adjusted DWR rain rates, and hourly and daily gauge \nrainfall obtained from the IMD stations are important.  \n \n \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 169 \n \n \n15.4. Algorithm Functional Specifications \n15.4.1. Overview: \nNOAA/NESDIS emphasizes use of meteorological satellites for the study of flash floods. Heavy \nprecipitation and flash floods are often a multi scale and concatenating event from the global scale \nto the synoptic scale, to the mesoscale and finally to the storm scale.  Satellite-derived algorithms, \nconceptual models, and interpretation techniques are used to provide information on these various \nscales to monitor, assess, and predict heavy precipitation and flash floods. In the satellite data, \nglobal scale connections between the tropics and middle latitudes are observed.   These \nconnections are movements, surges, or plumes of water vapor that are often associated with \nunstable air and prepare the environment for heavy precipitation and flash floods. On the synoptic \nscale, the 6.7 m water vapor is especially useful for detecting jet streaks, vorticity centers and \nother features that are associated with upward vertical motion and lift the moist, unstable air \nresulting in the production of clouds and precipitation.  Whether or not heavy precipitation and \nflash floods will occur are generally determined on the mesoscale to storm scale.  On the \nmesoscale, infrared (10.7 m and 3.9 m), visible, and water vapor (6.7 m) are used to locate \nboundaries (both frontal and thunderstorm-produced) and short waves that may initiate, focus, and \nmaintain the heavy precipitation.  Terrain features such as orographic uplift have the same effect \nof anchoring, intensifying,  and prolonging the precipitation.   On the storm scale, the intensity, \nmovement, and propagation of the precipitation system (e.g., thunderstorms) is used to determine \nhow much, when, and where the heavy precipitation is going to move during the next zero to three \nParameter \nResolution \nAccuracy \nSource \nDoppler \nWeather \nRadar \n- \nSurface Rain \n \nSurface Rain Gauge on hourly \nbasis (from Fast Response Rain \nGauges, AWS ) and Total Day \nbasis \nOriginal DWR \ngrid resolutions \n \n      \n70% \nas \ncompared with \nground \nbased \ndata \nDWR observations at \nIMD Sites (Every 1/2 \nHour,  \n \n------ At IMD Sites ---\n--- \n \nTRMM / GPM Rainfall \n1.

High resolution infrared (10.7 m) and visible are the principal data \nsets used in this diagnosis.   \nLarge scale precipitation values are of importance in many fields and anomalies in large scale \nprecipitation are also known to have a close relationship with global circulation anomalies. \nSatellite based rain estimation techniques can be classified into two broad categories, viz, (1) \nestimation of precipitation on near real time, e.g. Scofield and Oliver (1977), etc. and (2) estimation \nof average precipitation over a large area for a period of time ranging from a day to a month e.g., \nRichards and Arkin (1981) etc. In any of these two the estimation criteria is based on some \nstatistical relationship. \nIn case of GOES, data from five channels are used: the visible channel (0.65 mm), used when \navailable to select optically thick clouds; channel 2 (3.9 mm), used to retrieve reff of hydrometeors \nduring daytime; the water vapor channel (6.7 mm); and thermal channels 4 (11 mm) and 5 (12 mm). \nThe 11 mm channel is used to determine cloud-top brightness temperature, and the 12-mm channel \nis used in conjunction with the 11-mm channel to estimate cloud-top temperature. The estimated \ncloudtop temperature is utilized to compute the thermal emission at 3.9 mm, which is then \nsubtracted from measurements of that channel to yield the reflected solar radiation in the 3.9-mm \nspectral band. \nIn the statistical relationship between IR cloud pixel brightness temperature from satellite sensor \nand surface rainfall measurements  the mean rainfall rate R varies as a function of brightness \ntemperature (BT). But  the uncertainty in rainfall rate is quite large and also varies with BT.  The \nGPI method uses a simple two-piece threshold function approximation of this relationship  \nAlthough crude, the GPI method works quite well for the estimation of monthly rainfall over large \nareas, partly because the over- and underestimation of spatial and temporal errors cancel each other \nin the aggregation procedure.  \nComplete software package for derivation of QPE using Kalpana-1, INSAT-3D,3DR VHRR data \nfrom two important algorithms like GPI, and IMSRA has been attempted. Both of them are the \noperational at NOAA/NESDIS and has been developed after years of research and development \nefforts by various investigators. The theoretical background for GPI and GMSRA respectively are \ngiven below: \n15.4.1.1. Theoretical Background for GPI Algorithm:  \n15.4.1.1.1 Physical explanation of rainfall with infrared (IR) images \nThe satellite IR images are composed of measured radiant energy originating in the atmosphere or \nfrom the land and water surface below. The intensity of this energy integrated over all wavelength, \nby Stefan-Boltzmann law, is proportional to fourth power of temperature. The Stefan-Boltzmann \nlaw is valid for a perfect black body. If the medium emits spectral radiant energy according to \nsome temperature less than its thermal temperature, than a second factor called emissivity is \nintroduced. The emissivity of a body determine its emission efficiency. Thus, we can define \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 171 \n \nbrightness temperature of a body Tb, which is related to its physical  temperature  T by following \nequation:   \nTb =  T \nwhere,  is emissivity of the object. If.  = 1, Tb = T, its a black body; if  = 0, Tb = 0, its a white \nbody; if 0 <  < 1, Tb < T,  and its a gray body.  \nThe IR, for rainfall estimation, refers to thermal IR band that is 10.0 - 12.5 m. This is a \natmospheric window, and all earthly objects radiate maximum spectral power in this band. In this \nband the absorption is strong for clouds and land/water surfaces and slight for gaseous constituents \nof the atmosphere. For surfaces, which are opaque and do not transmit radiation, measured \nintensity is closely approximated by the fourth power of the temperature. For those surfaces, which \nare not   opaque - such as some clouds - measured intensity is approximated by effective emissivity \ntimes fourth power of the temperature. This effective emissivity will be referred more often as \ncloud emissivity here after. The cloud emissivity   cannot be measured from observations at a \nsingle wavelength interval. Often it is simply assumed to be unity. Then the temperature calculated \nfrom observed intensity of radiation is called `brightness temperature’. Only when  = 1, brightness \ntemperature equals to black body temperature. \nThe value of IR measurements to rainfall estimate lies in the nearly universal condition of lapse of \ntemperature with height through the troposphere. If the temperature is known with height, either \nfrom actual sounding or from climatology, the height of the cloud can be infrared from the satellite \nIR observations. Ordinarily, gray clouds are not useful in this context, because  < 1 implies clouds \nwhich are thin (and therefore without precipitation). The more serious problem is distinguishing \nbetween cold clouds that are radiometerelly thick but are confined to the upper and middle \ntroposphere, and cold clouds which extend into lower troposphere.  \n \n \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 172 \n \n15.4.1.1.2 Flow Chart for QPE from GPI: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nINSAT IR Data \n3 Hourly Image \nConversion from Grey \nCount to TBs \nLook Up Table for \nCalibration \nDetection of Deep \nConvective Clouds \nFractional \nRain Cloud \nEstimation of Rainfall \nGeneration of 24 \nClasses Histogram, \nmean & variance \nEstimation of daily \nRainfall (8 images) \nEstimation of Daily, Weekly, \nMonthly Rainfall \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 173 \n \n15.4.1.1.3. Operational Implementation \nStep 1 : Conversion from gray count to BT \nThe INSAT-3D infrared thermal images of 0000, 03000, 0600, …., 2100 UTC, i.e., every \nthree hours, are to be used. Infrared pixel has dimensions of 4x4 km in case of INSAT-3D, \n3DR, so that several pixels fall within 1.00x1.00 box. The grey shade value (0-1023) of \neach pixel in a given image is read and the corresponding brightness temperature is to be \ncalculated from a look-up table. Pixel lying outside the chosen area of analysis are to be \nignored while within it are assigned to appropriate box.  \nStep 2: Histogram Generation: \nAfter the temperatures of all the pixels in a box are known they are to be distributed to \ngenerate 3 hourly 24 class histogram of brightness temperatures of IR (11 um) images for \n1.0 x 1.0 deg  latitude /longitude boxes in an area -50 to + 50 deg.  lat and 30 to 130 deg \nlongitude from the sub-satellite point.  \nStep 3: Grid-wise Statistics  \nGenerate 3 hourly mean and spatial variance of temperatures at 1.0 x 1.0 deg  \nlatitude/longitude within the area 40 deg lat/long from the sub-satellite point. \nStep 4: Grid-wise Rain Clod Detection: \nThe fractional cloud coverage within a grid box is the ratio of the pixels of cooler than \nspecified threshold temperature to the total number of pixels. This gives the measure of the \nfractional area of the box covered by clouds with tops colder than threshold. Finally the \nestimates of precipitation using the GPI technique in the grid spacing of 1.0 x 1.0 lat/lon \nwill be carried out.  This work indicated a high correlation between the fractional coverage \nof \"cold\" clouds and observed rainfall. It was determined that the highest correlation \nbetween the parameters was produced using a 1.0 degree latitude/longitude spatial scale. \nAn estimation method using linear regression was developed. The regression procedure \nyielded the simple estimation equation:  \nR = [3 mm h-1] X [frac] X [hours]  \nwhere R is the rainfall estimate in millimeters; frac is the fractional coverage of cloud-top \ntemperature < 235K for the desired 1.0 degree latitude/longitude region; and hours \nindicate the number of hours in the observation period.  \nStep: 5 Validations: \nRegarding the validation of the derived QPE the DWR and Surface Rain Gauges (SFRG) \nData at different spatial and temporal scales will be highly desirable in and around the \nmaximum validation sites in temporal window of every hour.  \nRemarks: \nDuring the days when all the 8 images per day are not available, rain rate will be provided with a \nflag. Provisions of average rainfall estimation will be made for all the cases when  more than 50% \nof data is available. Similar approach will be followed with the Pentad or Monthly scale average \nrainfall estimates.  \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 174 \n \n15.4.1.2.  IMSRA Technique:  \n15.4.1.2.1. Theoretical Background: \nThe developmental work related to the INSAT Multi-Spectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA) \nproposed here as an inhouse R & D effort, originally follows the GMSRA approach along with \ninnovative alternative  features (i.e. the satellite microwave  radiometric measurements) for the \nestimation  of precipitation.   The theoretical basis is that \n1. Bright clouds in the VIS and clouds with cold tops in the IR imagery that are expanding (in \nearly and mature stages of development) produce more rainfall. \n2. Clouds with cold tops that are becoming warmer produce little or no rainfall. \n3. Merging of cumulonimbus (Cb) clouds increases the rainfall rate of the merging clouds. \n4. Most of the significant rainfall occurs in the upwind (at anvil level) portion of a convective \nsystem. \n5. Cloud micro-physics plays an important role in understanding the precipitation and thus \neffective radius of cloud top temperatures are to be known (say 3.9 mm during day time). \n6. For each pixel classified as containing raining clouds based on above criterions, the \nassociated instantaneous rain rate will be computed using pre-calibrated mean rain rate and \ncloud top brightness temperature relationship based on the equation developed using al \nlarge data base of IR-TBs and TRMM-Precipitation Radar data (Gairola et al. 2010b) The \nretrieved rainfall from earlier step and  Doppler Weather Radar data on available locations \nin India would be used for offline validation of the algorithm. This will be based on the \nlarge collocated data base of DWR and IMSRA rainfall within 0.1x0.1 deg resolution. \n7. Production of rainfall maps on every half hourly and daily basis on pixel scale with option \nfor higher grid spacing. \n \nSeveral such features are integrated in finalizing the estimation of rainfall using measurements \nfrom mult-spectral channels (Vis, IR, WV and microwave etc.). Physical explanation of rainfall \nwith infrared (IR) images have been discussed previously which is common for GPI algorithm. In \naddition the Physical explanation of rainfall with visible (vis) images is being presented here in \nbrief. Various researches so far have pointed that that with thicker clouds the probability of rainfall \nand rain intensity is increased. This relationship is strongest for clouds warmer than -15° C. It is \nalso noted that marine clouds produce heavier rainfall. The possible explanation for this lies in the \nprocess of cloud growth and droplet growth rates. In clouds warmer than -15° C, precipitation \nresults from coalescence. The large cloud thickness allows more time for growth before droplets \nfall out of the cloud. However, the other factors like droplet concentration, evaporation and cloud \ntemperature are also important. Differences in precipitation probability between marine and \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 175 \n \ncontinental clouds were attributed to difference in concentration of condensation nuclei and of \ndroplets, and difference in evaporation below the cloud base.  \nSatellite passive microwave and more recently, active microwave rain radar are able to provide \naccurate estimation of rain rates. However they are known to have  but poor temporal sampling. \nAgain the estimates from polar orbiting satellites are subject to the bias  in regions where diurnal  \ncycle of rainfall is pronounced. Still the instantaneous measurements of rainfall from microwave \nsensors are more accurate and thus are useful in calibrating other sensors like visible and IR.   At \npresent, the algorithms for the quantitative estimation of rainfall from microwave observations are \nquite successful but suffer from a scarcity of sufficient verification data over the oceans. \nTheoretical and empirical studies addressing the problem of rain  retrieval and their critical \nassessment continues to appear.  A definitive algorithm is contnuously in developing stage because \nof the complex and variable microphysical and mesoscale  structure of precipitation vis-à-vis \ncoarser resolution of microwave sensors.  As a source of microwave measurements, we use the \nrainfall data from the SSM/I Defense Meteorological Satellite Program  (DMSP). Several \nalgorithms have been developed for various SSM/I sensors of the DMSP series. The SSM/I rainfall \nused here is based on Ferraro and Marks (1995). The SSM/I had a conical scan with a swath width \nof about 1400 km and TRMM has swath width of about 800 km and the rainfall is retrieved by \nNASA-GPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm. Use of microwave data with those of VI/IR is most \nplausible choice to mitigate the problem of resolution in microwaves and augmentation of rain \nestimates from IR measurements.  \nFollowing the main features of Ba and Gruber (2001),  from GMSRA, IMSRA is thus proposed  \nin combination with additional satellite microwave measurements. Thus the principal innovations \nof IMSRA relative to previous infrared/visible algorithms alone is that it combines several cloud \nproperties used in a variety of techniques in a single and comprehensive rainfall algorithm.  \nHowever our recent sensitivity study has suggested that the environmental correction factor \n(PWRH) is more suitable for larger scale rainfall (such as in GPI within 10 x10) than for (IMSRA \nwithin or less than 0.10x0.10).  This factor now has not been invoked on IMSRA algorithm any \nmore. \n \n \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 176 \n \n15.4.1.2.2 IMSRA Algorithm \nFig. 2 Flow Chart for IMSRA Algorithm \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n15.4.1.3 Modified INSAT-3D Rainfall IMSRA scheme: \nSo far the IMSRA, that has been working as an operational algorithm at IMD combines mul-\ntispectral optical measurements of the satellites to estimate rainfall along with the additional \nsatellite microwave measurements.

The algorithm have the number of steps which are already \nencorporated and described in Gairola et al. (2007).   \nBased on a number of case studies and research works carried out during last few years, some \nmore innovative elements are recognized for further refinements of the algorithm. In this regard, \na three –tier correction scheme is designed for IMSRA algorithm based on the intercomparison \nwith TRMM-3B42 rainfall estimates. The Procedure adopts an overall correction of rain followed \nby corrections for orography and cloud growth/decay correction based on the study of Woodley , \nSancho and Vicente (1972).  Finally to further refine the IMSRA rainfall estimates   the synergistic \nuse of INSAT-3D derived IMSRA rainfall and rain gauge data from IMD is proposed based on the \nobjective criteria. \n Here the the original IMSRA algorithm has been retained as it is, except the environmental \ncorrection factor module has been dropped as it is adding more errors due to different decorelation \nlengths of rainfall and relative humidity & precipitable water. The flowchart of the modified \nalgorithm is given in Figure 3 where recent developments have been added to the original scheme \nin above flowchart Figure 2, tested and implemented in many case studies by Mahesh et al. (2015). \nThe global bias correction based on a priory data base is followed from a polynomial model of the \nform y=∑  ai xi, i=0...2 and the orographic correction is based on the climatology and using an \nelliptical weighting function (Mahesh et al., 2014). The global bias correction is designed on the \nbasis of comparison with TRMM-3B42 daily average rain (June and July). The average bias \nbetween the rain estimates of TRMM-3B42 and IMSRA rain is absorbed into a polynomial model. \nOrographic correction is computed on the basis of a climatological ratio bias between IMSRA and \nTRMM-3B42 for the orographic regions. It is applied as a symmetrically reducing elliptical \nweighting function of the form \nW= (A2 -  S2) / (A2  + S2 – 2LF2)       \n     A= d1 + d2 where d1 and d2 are the distances from the end points of a line with two foci as the \nends and A is the length of semi major axis. LF is the distance between two foci. S is the sum of \nEuclidean distance calculated for every point from the two foci. The graphical representation of \nthe function is given in figure 4. \n \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 178 \n \n \nFigure 3 : Flowchart of the proposed Modified IMSRA scheme \n \nFigure 4: contour plot of elliptical weighting function \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 179 \n \nThe cloud growth correction takes two consecutive IR images and makes rain/no rain distinction \nbased on the studies of Woodley and sancho (1971), Vicente et al.

Under this assumption, cloud growth correction factor is applied to discriminate \nrain/no-rain situation.

Validation \nRainfall products from the operational algorithms are to be obtained from two different methods \nmentioned above. These are required to be used for many diverse meteorological, climate, \nhydrological, agricultural, and other applications. It is therefore important to have an idea of their \naccuracy and expected error characteristics. This is done by validating the satellite precipitation \nestimates against \"ground truth\" from rain gauge and radar observations. A thorough verification \nof satellite-based precipitation products should quantify their accuracy in a wide range of weather \nand climate regimes, give users information on the expected errors in the estimates, help algorithm \ndevelopers understand the strengths and weaknesses of the satellite rainfall algorithms. To get good \nestimates of absolute accuracy satellite products are verified against very high quality radar and \ngauge data. However, these sites are only few in number. To get estimates of regional and spatial \naccuracy it is necessary to use a much larger quantity of data, for example, from national rain \ngauge networks. While these verification data are less reliable than those from high-quality sites, \ntheir errors are usually much smaller than those associated with the satellite estimates, at least on \nshort time scales. For validation of QPE with the ground truth on different temporal and spatial \nscale are required mainly with the data of DWR and Rain Gauges. \nFinally the retrieved rainfall from earlier steps and  Rain gauges and Doppler Weather Radar data \non available locations in India would be used both for calibration and validation of the algorithm. \nThe error analysis will be carried out and accordingly the algorithm will be fine tuned. A complete \nerror statistics (regression, correlation, RMSE, BIAS, Mean, Standard Deviation etc.) will be \nperformed for the desired period (validation period of about 3-4 months). \nRainfall maps on every 1/2 hourly and daily basis on pixel and any desired bigger grid spacing \nwill be produced with all provisions to have maximum possible information (like contours, color \nshades, statistical information etc.). Based on this algorithm QPE on  daily, pentad,  monthly mean, \nseasonal mean and annual mean will be produced. The capability of to derive QPE from IMSRA \nover meteorological subdivisions will be attempted along with Image Analysis System Group. \nAccordingly the algorithm will be made operational after due testing and validation. \n \n \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 183 \n \n15.6.1.

Method of Validation: \nCurrently pulsed Doppler technique are applied in weather radars to map severe storm reflectivity \nand velocity structure with great success in showing in real time the development of cyclones \nproviding quantitative measure of intensity, track and information on winds within and around the \nstorm. By studying the characteristics of radar returns and analyzing the variations in their \namplitude (or power received) , phase or frequency shift or change in polarization state, DWR \nquantifies the different characteristics of the precipitating medium within the pulse volume. The \namount of received power from the distributed target depends on the number of particles within \nthe pulse volume of the beam, their size, composition, shape, orientation etc. \n The DWR’s are located at various sites all over the country. All are working operationally.  DWR’s \nestimates 3 base products namely Reflectivity (Z), Velocity (V) and Spectrum Width (W) as a \nfunction of range. From these base products, advanced data products are required to be generated \nto meet the validation needs. \nGround-based radar and gauge rainfall observations (from IMD, ISRO’s AWS etc), at high \nresolution (hourly), are thus required to be used for validating rain  product. High resolution IMD \nDWR products (hourly 4 Km x 4 Km) is required for evaluation over several small size study sites \nwith hourly (daily when hourly is not available) rain-gauge density, for instance in 1°x 1° degrees. \nThe size of every validation study site varies from 0.5°x 0.5° to 2°x 2° degrees, depending on the \ndensity and distribution of available hourly rain-gauge stations over the study site and horizontal \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 184 \n \nrain extents. In case of proper validation of GPI rainfall in particular, which is for a grid size of \n1.00 x1.00, there should be minimum 3 rain gauges (IMD or AWS) to average out for comparison \nwithin a GPI grid size. For IMSRA, an hourly, and  daily DWR and rain gauge information would \nbe required on routine basis, preferably in 0.250x0.250 or atleast in 0.5°x0.5° grids.  \nPre-launch Field Experiments \nPre-launch validation campaign were launched earlier for existing Kalpana, INSAT-3A based \nrainfall algorithms as a prelude to INSAT-3D, 3DR. A three months period will be selected (mainly \nrainy season) for collecting data from DWRs, all possible and quality assured rain gauges and the \nalgorithm will be tested. \nPost-Launch Special Field Experiments \nMany of the present ground-truth observations data networks are being augmented  for the \nmeasurements of precipitation on ground. This includes the plans of IMD to put more DWR in \nvarious Indian regions. However, the existing ground based data sources will be utilized for the \nINSAT-3D Imager derived  rainfall estimates. Some more details of the validation campaigns \n(timing, location, instrumentation, etc.) will be decided later in mutual consultation with IMD. \n15.7. Merged Rain Products (IMSRA and Rain Gauges): \nTo merge in situ rainfall data from the AWS rain gauges with INSAT-3D derived IMSRA rainfall \nestimates, one of the simplest and state-of-the-art techniques, called the successive correction \nmethod (Cressman, 1959; Thiebaux and Pedder, 1987) has been found suitable enough for \nobjective analysis,. It involves the successive modification of satellite rainfall estimates based on \nobserved rain gauge rainfall data. The objective analysis scheme benefits from the relative \nadvantages of satellite and in situ data. In this method, the background field is corrected by the \nobserved values iteratively during several analysis scans until the correction between the \ninterpolated value and actual observation converges (Gairola et al. 2015). The interpolated weights \nare computed using the distance-dependent scheme and the correction (C) (Cressmaqn 1959) is \ndone using the following equation: \nC = ( ∑W (P0 – Pp)) / N \n \n (1) \nwhere Po is rainfall at the observation point, Pp is the interpolated grid point data at observation \npoint, N is the number of observations, and the weight (W) is given by \n   \nW= (R2 – d2) / (R2 + d2) for d2 ≤  R2 \n       \n    = 0 for d2 > R2 \n \n \n(2) \nwhere R is the radius of rainfall influence and d is the distance of the in situ data point from the \ngrid point. The appropriate radius of rainfall influence is determined by the spatial autocorrelation \nanalysis of daily IMSRA derived rainfall data. In recent study by  Gairola et al. 2015), the objective \nanalysis applied for rainfall estimates show noticeable improvement over the satellite-based \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 185 \n \nrainfall estimates. Comparison with independent rain gauge observations shows a considerable \nimprovement in terms of correlation, bias and root-mean-square error after objective analysis, \nespecially over the regions where density of rain gauge is fairly good. Overall results reveal that \nthe synergistic use of satellite and in situ observations has potential for more accurate rainfall \nestimations over the Indian monsoon region. \nFlow Chart for Merged Rain Products (IMSRA and Rain Gauges) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 5.

Major Conclusions \n The overestimation tendencies of IMSRA Rain can be considerably reduced by new scheme \n(Cloud growth & global bias correction). \n Orographic region shows significant improvement by the climatological orographic bias \ncorrection. \n Finally the merged rainfall over India from IMSRA and surface rain gauge data shows the \nIMSRA Rainfall (from Flow \nChart in Fig 3) \nObjective Analysis \nDaily National Rain \nGauge Data\nMerged Daily Rainfall \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 186 \n \nimproved rain estimates at a 0.1º latitude × 0.1º longitude spatial resolution.  \n While the modified IMSRA rain products will be available after every half hourly, the merged \nproducts will be generated every next day for daily rainfall subject to the availability of rain \ngauge data from IMD. \n15.8. Future Scope \nDue to the heterogeneity of precipitation over the Earth’s surface it is important that corrections \nbe applied time to time to the algorithms depending on region specific processes. Conventional \nmeans are restricted primarily to certain-land regions, and although satellite measurements are now \ncommonly available, these have limitations too. Frequent observations from visible (VIS) and \ninfrared (IR) sensors are hindered by the fact that estimates of precipitation are indirect and \ntherefore prone to errors caused by cloud-top to surface rainfall variations. More direct \nmeasurements of precipitation through the use of passive microwave (PMW) instruments are \nsomewhat restricted due their relative infrequent sampling of precipitation. Thus the algorithms \nfor merging of microwave data with IR images to generate rainfall rates at the spatial and temporal \nresolutions of the IR sensor is highly desirable. The combined approaches can improve rainfall \nestimates using the temporal sampling of the VIS/IR data and the more direct nature of the \nmicrowave estimates, avoiding the mentioned weaknesses and re-inforce the mutual strengths. At \npresent we have proposed to use Geostationary optical channels and low earth orbiting microwaves \nfor the rainfall estimation by their inter-calibration process and finally validations with the ground \ntruth. In future this approach can be further advanced by optimally integrating optical and \nmicrowave measurements by proper data assimilation schemes which will provide better rainfall \nthan any of the sensors (optical, microwave and ground truth) alone. \nIn future sensitivity studies could be made to estimate rainfall over the Indian monsoon region by \nthe synergistic use of the geostationary INSAT-3D -derived IMSRA rainfall estimates and rain data \nfrom GPM Microwave Radiometer (GMI), using a suitable objective analysis method. This will \nbenefit from high spatial and temporal resolutions of the geostationary satellite and infrequent but \nmore accurate microwave based rainfall estimates.   \n \n \nReferences \nAdler, R.

Introduction \nThis document describes the land surface reflectance retrieval algorithm for the MIR spectral band \n(3.8-4.0 µm) of Imager sensor of INSAT-3DR. MIR reflectance consists of both reflective  and \nemissive parts. Previous studies have shown that, full radiance (reflective and emissive) can not \nbe used for the studies involving global studies, where temperature gradients are due to the \nlatitudinal/topographical variations. We remove the emissive component using the brightness \ntemperature computed from the 11 µm channel and making simple assumptions about the \nemissivities and transmittivities in both the channels, i.e. MIR and 11 µm. These assumptions are \nfound to be conservative in the expected range of temperatures(T > 290 K). More appropriate \nvalues of emissivities and transmittivities would be adopted in the subsequent version of the \nalgorithm, which would evolve with time and experimentation. This algorithm is analyzed through \nthe comparison with the collocated and synchronous MODIS/METEOSAT surface reflectance \nproducts.  \n16.2.1. Overview and background \nMid-IR channel on Imager can be utilized for the detection of dark dense vegetation, burned areas \netc., which can be used for land use/cover dynamics related studies. Red and NIR channels are \ntraditionally used for detecting burned areas. However, these channels are highly affected by the \naerosol scattering and absorption caused by the biomass burning (Kaufman and Remer, 1994), and \nhence affects the values of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). MIR part of the \nspectrum is also sensitive for the changes in the state of the vegetation (due to active chlorophyll \nassociated with liquid water in the leaves), but it is virtually unaffected by the presence of most of \nthe types of aerosols (except dust). Monitoring the MIR reflectance can help to study the vegetation \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 194 \n \ncover more reliably. However, MIR reflectance should be used with caution for the studies \nperformed over global scales, only reflected component of the MIR should be utilized (Libonati et \nal., 2010). The emitted component of the signal may not represent the intrinsic properties of the \nsurface. We remove the emissive component using the brightness temperature computed from the \n11 µm channel of INSAT-3DR and making simple assumptions about the emissivities and \ntransmittivity in both the channels, i.e. MIR and 11 µm.  \n16.2.2.

Introduction \nThe process of evapotranspiration (ET) acts as one of the main drivers of the hydrological or water \ncycle. One of the distinguishing factors of ET is its role as a key player between the energy and \nwater cycles. The potential ET rate (ETo) is influenced by several factors such as solar radiation, \nwind speed, air temperature and vapour pressure deficit. Among them, solar radiation is the most \nsensitive parameter influencing almost 60-70% variability of ETo . The potential evapo-\ntranspiration (PET), hereafter referred as grass reference evapo-transpiration (ETo), is expressed in \nterms of amount of water transferred per unit time to atmosphere from water non-limiting surface \ncovered with a uniformly and actively growing short grass such as Alfalfa. ETo represents the \nevaporative demand of the atmosphere for a given climatic region. Deficiency in required supply \nof moisture leads to water stress. Reference evapo-transpiration is an agrometeorological variable \nwidely used in hydrology and agriculture. Together with precipitation, it is a major input in soil \nwater balance models. Several of these models require daily or hourly evapo-transpiration data to \nprovide acceptable estimate of plants’ water requirements. This would provide regional water \ndemand in different agro-climatic settings and agricultural growing season. The combination of \nspatial rainfall with ETo would help in monitoring water deficit and surplus during a growing \nseason for rainfed agriculture. \nSome contours of monthly climatic ETo have been generated by Department of Agricultural \nMeteorology, IMD (India Meteorological Department) from measurements of limited surface \nobservatories in India. But interpolation from such contours will propagate large errors. No digital \nmap of ETo is available to scientific community, modelers, resource managers and planners in \nIndia. Moreover, real-time updated spatial ETo product at weekly, ten-day, fortnightly and monthly \nscales would aid in knowing the intra and inter-seasonal climatic variability of water stress factors \nand their impact on deviation in biomass and yield. The climatic moisture index (ratio of rainfall \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 201 \n \nand PET) is essential to know surface wetness and suitability of sowing or transplanting operations. \nTherefore, it has the relevance for national agro-advisory services to farmers as well as crop \nforecasting. \n17.2.1. Overview and background \nThe latent heat of vaporization, which is the energy required for evaporating water is significant \nin weather and climate dynamics (Priestley & Taylor, 1972; Monteith,1973; Rowntree, 1991; \nAnderson et al., 2007). Although the concept of “evaporation” has been known since \napproximately 500 B.C. (see Brutsaert, 1982 for a chronological sketch), most of the understanding \nof the governing factors has been achieved in the last two centuries. Dalton (1802) was the first \nwho proposed relationship of vapor pressure deficit (esat−eact) of the near surface air to the \nevaporation rate. Later, many empirical relationships were developed based on other \nenvironmental factors (Blaney and Criddle, 1950; Hargreaves, 1975; Thornthwaite, 1948). Based \non available energy considerations and turbulent flux theory, Penman (1948) developed his \nevaporation equation for natural surfaces for water non-limiting conditions. This is known as \npotential evapotranspiration (PET).  Monteith (1964) developed a modified version of the Penman \nequation in which biophysics was introduced through a surface or canopy resistance – the now \nwell-known Penman–Monteith (P-M) combination equation – that allowed for vegetation control \non transpiration rates.  \nChoudhury (1997) proposed a method to assess by means of satellite data, such as remotely sensed \nsolar radiation, air temperature (derived from infrared images and weather station measurements) \nand vapor pressure deficit. This method provides good evapo-transpiration estimates for low-\nresolution applications such as worldwide scale and monthly time step. The accuracy is limited by \nthe high uncertainties provided by satellite-sensed vapor pressure estimation. \nLater, Bois et al. (2008) used remotely sensed solar radiation from METEOSAT observations from \nHeliosat-2 approach (Rigollier et al. 2004) and air temperature data to estimate ETo using \nHargreaves approach. The ETo can also be available as forecast bi-product from weather \nforecasting model. However, recent evaluation of predicted radiative fluxes and operational short-\nrange forecasts (24 hrs average) of routine weather elements from model for a limited winter \nmonths showed that the incident shortwave radiative flux produced the highest root mean square \nerror to the tune of 110% (Bhattacharya et al, 2012a) amongst others as compared to in situ \nmeasurements from INSAT-linked micrometeorological stations (popularly known as AMS). \nHowever, the errors of short-range forecast of air temperatures, relative humidity, atmospheric  \npressure, wind speed at 10 m height were 3%, 12%, 21% and 1.4% respectively over plain and \npleateu regions. The per cent RMSE for last four variables were found to increase in the hilly \nterrain (Bhattacharya et al, 2012a). Expectedly, the ET0 would have substantial errors propagated \nmainly from incident solar radiation flux estimation. on the other hand, the operational product on \ndaily insolation from Kalpana-1 VHRR produced around 25% RMSE (Bhattacharya et al, 2012b) \nwith respect to same ground reference and the per cent RMSE decreased with averaging over \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 202 \n \nweekly, ten-day, fortnightly and monthly scales up to 15%. After improvement in the cloud \nflagging and the spatial resolution of operational insolation product from INSAT 3D, it is expected \nto produce substantially less errors. Therefore, it seems wise to use the combination of daily \ninsolation product from INSAT 3D and operational forecasts of air temperatures, relative humidity, \nwind speed and atmospheric pressure to generate real-time digital and regional product of potential \nevapo-transpiration. \n17.2.2.  Objectives \nThe objectives of this document are : \n To outline the algorithm for the estimation of potential evapo-transpiration (ETo) based on \nPenman-Monteith (P-M) approach (FAO-56 model) \n To integrate operational product of daily insolation from INSAT 3D and 24 hrs average \noperational forecast of routine weather elements at finer spatial resolution to generate \nproduct of spatial ETo at 5 km spatial resolution \n To implement the algorithm in IMDPS GPR (Geophysical Parameter Retrieval) chain for \nautomation of ETo product generation \n To describe validation strategy against in-situ measurements with initial results \n \n17.2.3.    Instrument and characteristics of input products \n17.2.3.1 Indian geostationary satellite (INSAT 3D)  \nThe Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system is a joint venture of the Department of Space (DOS), \nDepartment of Telecommunications (DOT), and India Meteorological Department (IMD). INSAT \n3D is an exclusive meteorological satellite in the INSAT system, which was launched at \ngeostationary orbit in 2013. This radiometer consists of four bands : broad VIS (0.52-0.75), SWIR \n(1.55-1.70), MIR(3.8-4.0), WV(6.5-7.0) and two thermal TIR1(10.2-11.2), TIR2 (11.5-12.5) with \nnineteen sounder channel. The spatial resolution of VIS and SWIR band is 1 km x 1 km and 4 km \nx 4 km for MIR, WV and two thermal IR bands. The introduction of INSAT Meteorological Data \nProcessing System (IMDPS) provides both ‘full-globe’ and ‘sector’ data products in all the bands \nat half-an-hour interval at 4 km spatial resolution in an automated mode. So, there are maximum \n48 acquisitions on a given day. Raw data after reception at each acquisition were corrected for \nservo, line-loss, radiometry, stagger and oversampling removal using the INSAT 3D data products \nscheduler. This results into automated generation of co-registered data in each band at Transverse \nMercator (TM) projection.  The dimension of each band at each acquisition is 676 rows x 721 \ncolumns for Asia Mercator sector product.  \n \n \n \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 203 \n \n17.2.3.2.  Operational insolation product \nA spectrally integrated clear-sky and three-layer cloudy-sky models were developed to determine \nintegrated atmospheric transmittances and instantaneous insolation. Half-an-hourly observations \nfrom an Indian geostationary satellite sensor, INSAT 3D, were used to provide minimum ground \nbrightness (surrogate of surface albedo) from previous 30 days, cloud top albedo, brightness \ntemperatures, atmospheric water vapour as inputs to these models in addition to global eight-day \naerosol optical depth at 550 nm and columnar ozone. A trapezoidal scheme was implemented to \nobtain daily insolation (in MJm-2) from half-an-hour instantaneous insolation (Wm-2) throughout \nthe day for all-sky conditions (clear + cloudy). The whole algorithm (Bhattacharya et al, 2010 & \n2012b) will be operationalized  and daily insolation product can available at 4 km spatial resolution \nwith Transverse Mercator projection routinely from MOSDAC site (http://www.mosdac.gov.in).   \n17.2.3.3.

This version employs \nArakawa C-grid staggering for the horizontal grid and a fully compressible system of equations. \nThe terrain following hydrostatic pressure co-ordinate with vertical grid stretching is followed in \nvertical. The time-split integration uses 3rd order Runge-Kutta scheme with a smaller time step for \nacoustic and gravity wave modes. The WRF physical options used in this proposal consists of the \nWRF Single Moment 6-class simple ice scheme for microphysics (WSM6); the Grell-Devenyi \nensemble cumulus convection parameterization scheme; and the Yonsei University (YSU) \nplanetary boundary layer scheme.  \nThe WRF Model is integrated in a triple domain configuration with a horizontal resolution of 45 \nkm, 15 km and 5 km for the All India, with grid points 260×235, 352×373 and 676×721 in x and \ny directions for the domains 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The model has 36 vertical levels with the top \nof the model atmosphere located at 10 hPa. The WRF 3D-Var is used for the assimilation of all \navailable conventional including ISRO-AWS data and satellite observations to improve the model \ninitial conditions. The operational WRF short-range forecasts (Kumar et al., 2011), available at \nMOSDAC site used climatological land surface and atmospheric parameters from global database \nand assimilated all available conventional including ISRO-AWS and satellite observations (Kumar \net al., 2011; Singh et al., 2011) from Indian and other International agencies (e.g. EUMETCast).  \nThe operational forecast is available at finer spatial resolution (~ 5km) at three hourly interval upto \n72 hours. \nExamples of operational daily insolation product and 24 hrs average WRF forecast product of air \ntemperature, relative humidity, wind speed and atmospheric pressure over Indian region are shown \nin Figure 1. \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 204 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1.

The ETo again decreases in October and November but \nthere is rise in western part of India during December due to increase in day length in last dekad \nof December.  \n17.7.1.  Sensitivity of P-M model to weather variables for error budgeting \nThe sensitivity of P-M model ET0 was carried out by Bois et al (2008) using ‘Sobol’ method. It \nconsists of numerous simulations of the models using two independent samples of ‘N’ repetitions \n(rows) and ‘k’ input variables (columns), retrieved from existing data or randomly generated data \nfrom the probability distribution function (PDF) of each ‘k’ input variable. One or several variables \nin the first sample are substituted by the same variable (s) taken from the second sample. For each \nof the (2k - 1) possible combinations of variable substitutions between the two samples, ‘N’ runs \nof the model are computed. The sensitivity of the model to input variables was based on so-called \nsensitivity or Sobol’ indices, which were calculated on the principle of the decomposition of the \ntotal variance (V) of the model output, in response to individual or simultaneous variations of the \n‘k’ model inputs. \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 213 \n \n \nFigure 3. Example of monthly distribution of ET0 from VHRR insolation and WRF forecasts over \nIndian region \nIn oceanic climate, the results of monthly sensitivity analyses computed using Southwest area \n(SW) data show clear seasonal trends (Figure 4). During the winter period (from November to \nFebruary), wind speed is the main source of variation in ET0 values calculated using P-M method \n(e.g. 38% of ET0 total variance in January). Then come relative humidity and air temperature (32% \nand 17% of ET0 total variance in January, respectively). Solar radiation, daily amplitude of air \ntemperature and daily amplitude of relative humidity have little impact on evapo-transpiration \nprocess during winter. This trend changes during March and October. From April to September, \nET0 is mostly sensitive to solar radiation (up to 74% of ET0 total variance in May, and 70% in \nJuly). From May to July, P-M formula is not very sensitive to relative humidity, air temperature \nand their diurnal amplitudes. Mean daily air temperature participate from 11% to 15% of ET0 \nvariance, from May to September. Total sensitivity indices show that, when added to other \nvariables’ variations, air temperature has a greater impact on ET0 variability during summer, and \nwind speed has a greater impact during winter (Figure 4B).  \nIn Mediterranean climate, sensitivity of ET0 computation to climate input variables using P-M \nmethod in Southeast area (SE) is very close to the one observed. Wind speed as a major impact on \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 214 \n \nET0 calculation during winter and solar radiation is clearly the most influent variable during \nsummer (Figure 4C and D). The present analysis highlights the great sensitivity of this Penman–\nMonteith formula to solar radiation during summer period, when ET0 reaches its highest values, \nand when its calculation is critical for irrigation process and ecological modelling. These results \nwere obtained for Mediterranean and Oceanic climate, at medium latitudes. A recent work \npublished by Gong et al. (2006) on a large range of climatic conditions in Southern China leads to \nsimilar results, except for relative humidity which had a greater impact on ET0 during winter than \nit has been shown in the present study. Considering the results of Penman–Monteith sensitivity to \nsolar radiation, it seems reasonable to evaluate the benefits of satellite-sensed solar radiation to \nET0 calculation.  \n \nFigure 4.

Preliminary comparison with in-situ measurements \nThe daily insolation product (Bhattacharya et al., 2012b) from K1VHRR available through \nMOSDAC (Meteorological and Oceanic Satellite Data Archival Centre) for the period January 1, \n2011 to December 31, 2011 to derive radiation parameters and other routine inputs from WRF \nforecast were ingested into P-M model to generate daily, dekadal (ten-day) and monthly ET0 \nestimates at regional scale following the steps mentioned in section 4.12. To validate satellite based \nregional ETo estimates, the measurements from INSAT-linked AMS (Agro-Met-Station) data were \nused (Bhattacharya et al, 2009). The AMS provides all radiation and meteorological variables at \n30 minutes interval and represent a fetch area of 1 km x 1 km. The AMS data from six sites over \ndifferent agro-climatic zones were used to compute ETo on daily basis for different time period as \nlisted in Table 6.

Validation results \nA. Daily scale \nDaily ETo estimated using P-M approach was compared with daily ETo computed from AMS \nmeasurements for different agro-climatic regions as listed in Table 6. The 1:1 plot is shown in \nFigure 5 and temporal comparison is shown in Figure 6. The daily ETo computed from AMS varied \nfrom 0.7 mm to 12.0 mm while satellite derived ETo varied from 1.1 to 11.7 mm over different \nseasons for selected stations. The error analysis showed the root mean square deviation (RMSD) \nvaried from 1.13 to 3.82 mmd-1 to the tune of 21 to 38 % of measured mean over six stations (Table \n7). The overall pooled data set showed RMSD of 1.34 mmd-1 with 29% deviation from measured \nmean. This was due to high fluctuation of ETo on daily temporal scale as shown in Figure 5 for all \nsix AMS stations.

The dekadal \nchange in estimated ETo matched well with AMS ETo. The seasonal change was also well captured \nin 10-day cumulative ETo.  \nIn Naraingarh, Punjab, the comparison was made for the period from January to April. In January \nand February, ETo remained low in the range of 16 mm to 24 mm due to low radiation and \ntemperature. It started rising in March and reached up to 62 mm per dekad.

During this \nperiod rabi rice is grown with available irrigation facility. The dekadal temporal profile of \nestimated ETo matched well with AMS ETo but showed small amount of deviation during April. \nThis may be due to application of irrigation water in rice crop and was only captured in computed \nETo from AMS but not reflected in estimated ETo. The temporal variation of dekadal ETo was 28 \nto 30 mm in January with gradual rise in February. The maximum ETo was observed in April due \nto rise in temperature and radiation load. This seasonal change of ETo was well captured in the \nestimates.  The overall RMSD was found to be 10.5 mm (27.4 % of AMS mean) on January to \nApril with respect to AMS.   \nThe central plateau and hill agro-climatic region is represented here by AMS at Powarkheda site. \nThe area falls under the catchment of Narmada where annual rainfall varies from 800 to 1200 mm. \nThe wheat crop is dominant during rabi season. The estimated dekadal ETo estimates matched well \nthroughout January to May. The dekadal high and low value matched quite well and estimated ETo \nalways remained high as compared to AMS ETo up to March during growth of wheat crop. After \nthat, estimated ETo underestimated measured ETo.  In January, both showed low values in the range \nof 30 to 37 mm and 35 to 46 mm but goes up to 97 to 103 mm (AMS) and 82 to 94 mm (estimated) \nin May. The temporal profiles matched quite well and showed RMSD of 10.4 mm over ten days \n(16.6% deviation from AMS mean). \nThe typical Indian arid region lies in western, dry agro-climatic region and represented here by \nJaisalmer. The climate remains hot throughout the year except in January and February. The data \nover  monsoon season (July, August and September) were used for computation of ETo.

During July, ETo remained higher but later in the season it reduced in both the cases. \nThe satellite estimated ETo showed both underestimation and overestimation for selected season \nas compared to AMS. The temporal profile of ETo of two followed the same pattern. The RMSD \nof 6.3 mm was found for monsoon season which is 10.2% with respect to AMS ETo.  \nThe southern part of India, AMS located in LPSC Mahandragiri represents the natural scrub \nvegetation. The AMS data for January to May and August to November were used for comparison \nwith AMS ETo value. The temporal profile of dekadal ETo matched well with AMS ETo. The \ndifference between two was maximum during north-east monsoon season (January to February) \nbut later on, the difference was reduced further in May and November. The data showed a RMSD \nof 9.4 mm (21.4% deviation of measured AMS mean).  \nThe island agroclimatic region of Andaman & Nicobar have different climatic conditions as \ncompared to above stated regions. As this region is surrounded by Bay of Bengal so climatic \ncondition remains humid throughout the year. The data from March to May and August to \nNovember were used for comparison. The AMS ETo on an average had a range of 23 to 50 mm \nthroughout the selected time domain. Similar order of magnitude was observed for estimated ETo. \nThe dekadal behaviour of estimated ETo matched well with AMS ETo but showed little higher \ndeviation during August and September. It showed RMSD of 9.3 mm (25.0% of AMS mean).      \n \n \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 222 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 7.

Error analysis of ETo for variable-time accumulation \nThe daily estimated and AMS ETo was compared for different time windows viz. 3-day, 5-day, 7-\nday and 10-day. The correlation coefficient between estimated and measured ETo gradually \nincreased from daily to 10-day but maximum increase was observed from daily to 7-day i.e from \n8% to 23% for six AMS stations. The rise of correlation coefficient from 7-day to 10 days was \nnominal in Nariangarh (PAU) (0.7%), Chakdah (BCKV) (2%), Pawarkheda (2.3%) and Jaisalmer \n(6.3%) as compared to LPSC (Mahandergiri) (13.8%) and Diglipur (12.6%) as shown in Figure 8. \nSimilarly per cent deviation from mean of AMS measurements also showed a similar trend as the \ndeviation drastically came down from daily to 7-days and further nominal decrease in 10-day \nexcept than in Jaisalmer. For the latter, it decreases from 14.8% to 10.2% for 7 to 10-days as \nmarked in Figure 9. The analysis showed that error was significantly reduced from daily to 7-days \nand further in 10-days over different agro-climatic zones. This will help us use this ETo data in \nvarious applications on different time scales with known errors.      \n  \n \n  \nFigure 9. Error analysis of ETo for variable-time accumulation \n17.7.1.4. Comparison of errors from similar studies elsewhere \nConsidering the results of Penman–Monteith sensitivity to solar radiation, it seems reasonable to \nevaluate the benefits of satellite-sensed solar radiation to estimate spatial ETo as no regular spatial \nrecord are available for solar radiation. Choudhury (1997) attempted monthly global ETo at 0.25o \nx 0.25o from P-M method using solar radiation from International Satellite Cloud Climatology \nProject (ISCCP). He derived vapour pressure and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) from TIROS \noperational vertical sounder TOVS data with air temperature based on interactive GCM forecast \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 225 \n \nretrieval assimilation system applied to the TOVS data. He has compared the estimated ETo with \nlysimeter data and on monthly scale the error was found between 15 to 40% from measured mean.  \nBois et al. (2008) used remotely sensed solar radiation and weather data from AWS equipped with \nhumidity, thermal sensors and cup anemometer to estimate ETo using FAO-56 P-M  method. They \nused the solar radiation prepared from Meteosat data by following Heliosat-2 method (Rigollier et \nal. 2004). The study found that most of the errors occurred in partial cloudy days due to \nuncertainties in retrieving daily solar radiation. On daily scale, the RMSD was between 0.34 to \n1.32 mm (11% to 110% from daily mean) but on annual scale the RMSD remained low (11% of \nETo mean value) at 0.05o X 0.05o spatial resolution. This error again came down to (9.1% to 5% \nof ETo mean value) during clear days in summer.  Our study was unique as we used operational \nproduct of K1VHRR insolation WRF 3-hourly forecast for at 0.05°grid for estimation of ETo at \n0.08o X 0.08o. On daily scale, RMSD  was 1.1 to 3.8 mm (21% to 38% from measured mean) but \nit came down to 10% to 28% from mean on dekadal time scale and further in monthly scale (21% \nfrom monthly mean). The overall error at different temporal domain were found in good harmony \nwith reported errors in other part of world.   \n17.8. Sources of errors / uncertainties in ETo estimates and validation issues  \nThe following sources of uncertainties were traced out while evaluating spatial output of ETo \nestimates and its comparison with ground reference \n(i) Influence of vegetation in AMS \nThe FAO 56 P-M method is generally applied for a specific site using meteorological and radiation \ndata from meteorological observatories or AWS weather data including direct measurement of \nradiation. In India, ISRO-AWS does not provide solar radiation data in terms of standard energy \nunits. IMD AWS provide data with some lag period. The sensitivity analysis of P-M method by \nGong et al. (2006) and Bois et al. (2008) highlighted that solar radiation and wind speed were \nclearly the most influent variables for ETo estimation. The pyranometer and routine weather data \nfrom AMS are used. But these measurements were recorded over different vegetation cover types. \nSince vegetation growth influences ambient weather conditions, the ETo computed from AMS \nwould definitely have differential vegetation influence when compared to ETo estimates from \nintegration of satellite based solar radiation and WRF forecast weather variables.  \n(ii) Scale mismatch \nSpatial ETo was generated at approximately 8 km spatial resolution with 64 km2 pixel area      while \nthe average footprint of AMS varies from 0.25 to 1 km2. This scale mismatch puts constrain in \nvalidation statistics. But this scale mismatch will reduced with INSAT 3D.  \n \n \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 226 \n \n(iii) Difference in time sampling \nFor spatial ETo, daily solar radiation was generated from diurnal observations at instantaneous \nsnapshots with half-an-hour interval from satellite platform. But half-an-hourly averages from \nAMS measurements were used to generate validation datasets \n(iv) Accuracy in cloud flagging  \nThe product version of surface insolation algorithm has cloud detection capability of \napproximately 80%. It could not detect thinner clouds. Therefore, ETo estimates have higher errors \nduring the period more cloudy spells or for AMS sites with higher cloud dynamics such as Diglipur \n(A & N), LPSC, Mahendragiri etc. \n(v) Quality of WRF forecast \nAn initial evaluation of WRF forecast quality showed an average error to the tune of 1-2°C, RH of \n5-10% as compared to large error in wind speed and predicted radiation terms. The inherent errors \nin first three variables will have implications on the overall error budget. \n17.9. Future scope of improvement  \nRecent improvement has taken place in the cloud detection of INSAT  3D insolation algorithm \nusing additional criteria based on cloudiness index from VIS band observations. Much of the \nuncertainties in insolation and ETo estimates in cloudy-skies will hopefully be improved. \nRecent study on impact of updated vegetation fraction from INSAT 3A CCD showed improvement \nin air temperature, humidity and rainfall forecast from WRF. The use of real-time satellite based \nother land surface products such as albedo, LAI and soil moisture would definitely help in \nimproving the quality of operational forecasts. Future work should address the retrieval / \nestimation of those variables from Indian geostationary satellites.  \nThe INSAT 3D will provide relatively finer spatial resolution of observation of insolation. This \nwould reduce the scale mismatch uncertainty for validation. \n \n \n                     INSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018               \n \n \n \n 227 \n \nReferences \nAllen, R., Pereira, L., Raes, D., Smith, M., 1998.

Using these data quadratic coefficients (slope, offset \nand quadratic term) for EOM 10°C, 25°C and 40°C were generated. Based on EOM \ntemperature of an acquisition lab slope, offset and quadratic term are derived and provided in \nproduct. \n \nIn HDF products a field named “invert” (provided as attribute of each channel dataset) \nindicates whether image counts are inverted or not. While computing the radiance values the \ncounts should be inverted (only for bands having invert = True) .The lab coefficients \nprovided for Count to radiance conversion are used in following way: \n \nCount = DNMax- Count (only if invert = True) \n \n Where DNMax 1023 for Imager and DNMax = 16383 for Sounder \n \nR (in mw cm-2 sr-1 um-1)  =  lab_radiance_quad*(Count)2 +   \nlab_radiance_scale_factor*(Count) + lab_radiance_add_offset \n \n Online calibration is performed using onboard internal blackbody serving as a \"hot target\" \nand space view count as \"cold target\". From these two online slope and offset are computed. \nQuadratic term is derived using inter sensor calibration. \n23 \n \nIn HDF products a field named invert indicates inversion of image counts. While computing \nthe radiance values the counts should be inverted (only for bands having invert = True) . The \nonline coefficients provided for Count to radiance conversion are used in following way: \n \nCount = DNMax- Count (only if invert == true) \nWhere DNMax 1023 for Imager and DNMax = 16383 for Sounder \n \nR (in mw cm-2 sr-1 um-1)=online_radiance_quad *(Count)2 + \nonline_radiance_scale_factor*(Count)+online_radiance_add_offset \n \nCOUNT TO BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURE \n \nCount can be converted to Brightness Temperature (BT) using 2 methods: \n \n Using LUT provided in the product (XXXX_YYY_TEMP, where XXXX is Sensor YYY is \nBand).  \n First convert count to radiance as discussed above and then generate BT from radiance using \ninverse planck's law as given below.  \n \nbrightness_temperature = C2 / (cwl * log(C1 / (1.0E6 * rad_w_m2 * pow (cwn, 5.0)) + 1)) \n \nWhere  \n \ncwl(metres)= central_wavelength(um)/1000000.0  (Field central_wavelength in product) \n            rad_w_m2 = radiance*10.0 (For converting from mw cm-2 sr -1 um-1 to w m-2 sr-1 um-1) \n            h = 6.6260755e-34 kg m2 s-1; \n            c = 2.9979246e+8 ms-1; \n            k = 1.380658e-23 kg m2 s-2 k-1; \n            C1 = 2.0 * h *c * c; \n            C2 = (h * c) / k; \n \n \nRECOMMENDATION: It is recommended to use coefficients of type of calibration \n(Radiometric_Calibration_Type) to generate radiance from counts. The other calibration source \nat some times may have issues. \n24 \n \nAppendix- II : INSAT-3D Geometric Calibration \n \n \n1. INSAT-3D IMAGER \n \na) IMAGER L1B and L2B products are Fixed Grid product generated using GEOS [5] \nprojection.

The Hydro-\nEstimator developed at SAC is based on similar operational \nmethod \nat \nNOAA/STAR. \nThe \nH-E \nis \noperationally \nimplemented. This report addresses the validation of H-E in the \npresent form. It is found that the H-E in its present form works \nwell over most parts of the country but has weakness over hilly \nterrains. The problem is identified and a modified H-E is \nproposed. The modified H-E shows a good representation of \nrain over hill terrains. Overall, it gives a correlation of 0.78 and \nrms difference of 46.64 mm when compared with weakly \nmeteorological \nsubdivision \nsurface \nmeasurements. \nIts \ncomparison with TRMM 3B42 V7 also provides the same \ncorrelation and rms difference. It is also found that comparison \nstatistics of weekly met subdivision averaged surface \nobservations with H-E is nearly same as that with 3B42 V7. \nHowever, \nthe \nweek-by-week \ncomparison \nof \nsurface \nmeasurements with H-E is more stable than with 3B42 V7. In \ndaily 0.25ox0.25o grid, the correlation and rms difference over \nland between surface observations and H-E is 0.47 and 25.40 \nmm/day. A slightly higher correlation of 0.59 and lowered rms \ndifference of 22.40 is observed between H-E and 3B42 V7. \nThese comparison statistics are in agreement with comparison \nof surface observations with 3B42 V7. The similar comparisons \nover oceans are conducted between H-E and 3B42 V7, which \nshow a correlation of 0.65 and rms difference of 15.88 mm/h. \nThe advantage of H-E over 3B42 V7 is its near real time \ndissemination.

Rain \ngauges offer point measurements and thus they do not represent spatial variability of \nthe precipitation that varies from few meters to several kilometers. The distribution of \nthe rain gauges is far from adequate to present the meaningful variability for the study of \nvarious rain-induced events/processes, like flash flood, dam failure, river catchment, \netc.  On the other hand, radars are better representative of the areal rain, but their \ncoverage is limited due to their high cost. The radar measurements often suffer due to \npoor calibration of radar reflectivity and also of Ze-R relationship. Apart from that, \nground clutter and anomalous propagation also mars its usability. At the time of severe \nweather conditions, ground based observation network often fail to work. In view of the \nlimitations of the ground measurements, the most convenient means to measure the \nprecipitation over large area is by using the satellite-based methods. The satellites offer \nfrequent uniform coverage over large area. However, the satellite measurements also \nsuffer from large errors. While Vis./IR methods suffer from their inability to sense \nhydrometeors directly (Bhandari and Varma, 1995), microwave measurements suffer \ndue to their coarser spatial and temporal resolution, rain variability within their large \nfootprint referred as beam filling problem, uncertainty in the drop-size distribution, drop \ntemperature, fall velocity and shape and orientation of the drops etc. (Varma et al, 2003, \nVarma and Liu, 2006, Varma and Liu, 2010, and Varma and Pal, 2012).  \nDue to inherent inability of IR measurements to directly sense the hydrometeors, the \nrain retrieval using them is always indirect in nature. In the past, there are a number of \nmethods developed for rain estimation (barrett and Martin, 1981); they range from very \nsimple algorithms in which brightness temperature (Tb) is directly related to rain rate \n(e.g., Arkin et al., 1989) to those which involved complex hypothetical models (e.g., \nScofield, 1987). Scofield (1987) described a method for measuring the intense \nprecipitation over a storm. His method called Interactive Flash Flood Analyzer (IFFA) \nthat used half-hourly satellite images to measure the precipitation over the active area \nof a storm. His technique involved the skill of a trained meteorologist to find out active \nportion of a storm. He also utilized the total atmospheric precipitable water (TPW) and \nwater vapour (WV) correction to make modifications for dry/wet environment and \nequilibrium level adjustments for rain that comes from the warm clouds. This method \nwas found to be successful for measuring precipitation but was highly subjective and \nneeded continuous interaction of a trained meteorologist to decide the precipitation \namount. Thus, it was found difficult to implement it with ease.  Successively, an \nalternate method called Auto-Estimator (A-E) was developed. The aim of the A-E was to \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 \n4 \n \nprovide an automated method without human intervention and that could automate the \nsubjective nature of the IFFA, but A-E failed on many occasions because many features \nof IFFA were not properly implemented in it. Hydro-Estimator is most recent of the \nattempts by NOAA/NESDIS to improve and make IFFA automated (Scofield and \nKuligowaski, 2003). The H-E incorporated many new features that were either not \npresent in IFFA or were defined differently. \nA brief summary of the Hydro-Estimator is provided in section 2 below. Further details of \nHydro-Estimator technique can be found in Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document \n(ATBD) (Varma and Gairola, 2013).  \n \n2.0  Hydro-Estimator \n \nThe H-E method offers improvement over A-E method for precipitation estimation. In A-\nE method, the relationship between 10.7 m brightness temperature (Tb) and rain rate \n(mm h-1) (R) is defined as:  \n \nR = a exp(-bTb\n1.2),                                            -----(1) \n \nwhere, a and b are regression coefficients having values a= 1.1183*1011; b=0.036382 \n(Vicente et al. 1998). The A-E method provides same relationship for core and non-core \nprecipitation. The above equation provides first guess of the precipitation value for core \nrain and is hereafter referred as (Rc). In H-E, the rain is determined by the cloud growth \nat the given pixel relative to the surrounding pixels. The H-E method ensures heavier \nrain for growing clouds, in the upwind portion of the storm with overshooting tops. The \ncore and non-core fractions of the precipitation are identified and different R-Tb \nrelationships are provided for them. This allows higher precipitation rates for the \nconvective cores. For convective core, an equation similar to (1) is used, however the \ncoefficients a and b are dynamic in nature, and which depends upon available TPW   as \nprovided by National Centre for Environmental Predictions (NCEP/NOAA) Numerical \nWeather Prediction (NWP) model derived fields. This allows higher precipitation value \nfor wetter atmosphere. The above (1) is constrained with precipitation value of 0.5 mm \nh-1 at Tb =240 K, and a precipitable water (from NCEP  model) dependent  value at Tb \n=210 K. In H-E method, the maximum possible rain at any pixel is limited depending \nupon availability of TPW. This allows the maximum precipitation as a function of \navailable moisture. The maximum possible rain value in mm/h is restricted to 40 times \nthe precipitable water in inches.  \n \nIf a pixel is assigned maximum rain but there exist a colder pixel in its vicinity. In \nprinciple, the rain rate at the colder nearby pixel would be higher. Thus the rain rate \ncurves are recomputed based on rain rate of 0.5 mm/h at 240 K and of the theoretical \nmaximum value at the lowest temperature in the vicinity. \n \nFor a non-convective core, the relationship between Tb and Rn is given as: \n \nRn=(250-Tb) * (Rmax/5)                  -----------------(2) \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 \n5 \n \n \nRmax is again a function of PW. Rn is not allowed to exceed - corresponding Rc rain \nrate or 12 mm/h, whichever is lower. \n \nIn H-E method, the precipitation at a pixel is considered to comprising of core and non-\ncore fractions.  This is worked out by considering an area of 101X101 pixels \nsurrounding the pixel under consideration. The minimum, mean and standard deviation \nof Tb (Tmin ),  in this area is determined. This Tmin is used to find the radius of actual \nregion of interest. Within this radius of interest, the mean (Tmean) and standard deviation \n() of Tb are determined. The active/inactive and also core/non-core fraction of the pixel \nis determined through the parameter Z,  \n \nZ = (Tmean- Tb)/           ----------(3) \n \nThe minimum and maximum allowable value of Z are 0 and 1.5.   \n \nIf Z < 0;  H-E rain (R) = 0, i.e., pixel either cirrus or inactive convective \n \nOtherwise, R = [Rc*Z2 + Rn * (1.5 - Z)2] / [Z2 + (1.5 - Z)2]    --------------(3) \n \nRc is the rain from the convective core given by (1) with coefficients determined by PW \nfrom NCEP NWP model. Rn is rain from non-convective core given by  (2). If Z=1.5, the \npixel rain rate R reduces to convective type only (given by (1)). On the other hand, if \nZ=0, the pixel rain rate R is determined by purely non-convective rain (given by (2)). \n \nIn fact, the convective systems generally have multiple brightness temperature minima, \nand hence a single radius is inappropriate for differentiating local from global minima. \nThus, this same computation of rain rate is performed for a smaller (15-pixel) radius, \nand the final rain rate is the square root of the product of the two rates. The exception to \nthis is if the rain rate computed from the smaller radius is zero, in which case it is not \nconsidered in the final rain rate calculation. \n \nThe (3) above provides the first guess precipitation amounts. The precipitation thus \nestimated is further modified to account for the wetness/dryness of the atmosphere and \nalso for the precipitation that comes from the warm clouds. The several steps involved \nfor such modifications are as follows: \n \n2.1 Correction for Wet/dry Environment \n \nA small correction in the brightness temperature (Tb) values is carried out to account for \nwetness of the environment. This adjustment is needed to account for evaporation of \nthe precipitation in the dryer environment below the cloud. A higher or lower value of the \nbrightness temperature at 10.7m is set for drier or wetter environment.  This is carried \nout in two steps. In the first step, brightness temperature is adjusted based on the TPW \nvalue to compute rain rate from (3). In the second step, first, the relative humidity (RH) \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 \n6 \n \nitself from the NCEP model is adjusted to account for the falling rain, and then \ndepending upon RH value, a subtraction from the rain amount given by (3) is made.   \n \n2.2 Warm-top modification \n \nThe equilibrium level or Level of Neutral Buoyancy (LNB) is computed by following a \nparcel along a saturation adiabat upward (from lifting condensation level) to where the \nparcel temperature becomes equal to the environmental temperature. Strength of the \nconvection is determined by a comparing the temperatures of the convective tops with \nthat of equilibrium level. This level lies below tropopause for the warm rain. \n \nIn H-E method, NCEP model temperature and dewpoint profiles are used to determine \nequilibrium temperature (Teq) of a particulate pixel. This correction is applied to pixels \nthat are warmer than the equilibrium level temperature.   \n \n If  the (Teq- Tmin) < 10 K, then Tmin in the pixel-area is used instead of Tb of the \npixel for warm top correction.   The modification is as follows: \n \nTb – [(213-Teq)*0.9] or 25 K (whichever less) \n If the (Teq- Tmin) > 10 K, the modification is as follows \nTb  – [(213-Teq)*0.6] or 15 K (whichever less) \n \n2.3 Orographic Correction \n \nCorrections for the orography induced rain and the rain from warm clouds are also \napplied. This correction is carried out to ensure enhanced rain amounts along windward \nside and reduced rain amounts along leeward side of the mountains. The orographic \ncorrection is carried out by determining by gradient of the elevations in the direction of \nthe prevailing 850 mb level winds (Vicente et al., 2002).  \n \n \n3.0  Sample Results and comparisons \n \nThe H-E method which is currently operational at Indian Meteorological Department \n(IMD) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) uses INSAT-3D Imager thermal \ninfrared (TIR) observations at 10.7 µm along with environmental parameters taken from \nNumerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model to make a quantitative assessment of the \nprecipitation. The H-E technique provides rain rate at each pixel with every acquisition \nof the satellite data (presently, 4x4 km2 and 30 minutes for INSAT-3D). The procedure \nand coefficients are adopted from H-E method developed by NOAA/STAR. \n \nHydro-Estimator performed reasonably well over the land and oceans. As an example, \nFig. 1 shows the instantaneous H-E rain on 23 September 2013 at 1200 UTC from \nINSAT-3D along with H-E rain as derived by NOAA using Meteosat and rain from \nTRMM 3B41RT. There is a good qualitative agreement between rain rates derived \nusing INSAT-3D and Meteosat. Though H-E rain by NOAA and by us uses the same \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 \n7 \n \ntechnique and coefficients, the difference between the two methods still exists due to \ntheir different inputs. While INSAT-3D based H-E algorithm used 0.5ox0.5o gridded 6 \nhourly NCEP Global Forecasting System (GFS) model derived parameters whereas \nNOAA algorithm uses high-resolution ETA model derived fields. Nevertheless, there is \ngood qualitative agreement between H-E rain derived from INSAT-3D and Meteosat. \nThere is also fairly good qualitative agreement between H-E rain from INSAT-3D and \nfrom 3B41RT. The 3B41RT is microwave based hourly rain rates.  \n  \nFig.1: Rain rate in (mm/h) on 23 Sep. 2013 at 1200 UTC from (a) INSAT-3D by SAC, \n(b) GMS by NOAA and (c) TRMM 3B41RT. \n  \nDespite of having good agreement over most of the regions, the rain over the \nHimalayan region is not well picked up by H-E rain from INSAT-3D as well as from \nMeteosat. This issue is dealt in modified H-E that is described in the later part of this \nreport. \n \nFigure 2 show another example of INSAT-3D derived instantaneous H-E rain \nassociated with Phaillin cyclone from 10 – 13 Oct. 2013. The Fig. 2 (a) to (h) shows the \ndevelopment to decay of the cyclone in chronological order. The intense rain associated \nwith eye-wall as well as spiral clouds bands of the cyclone is clearly seen. The H-E also \nvery well picked up the eye of the cyclone as rain-free area. The distribution as well as \nthe intensity of the H-E rain associated with cyclone is found to be in agreement with the \nobserved history of the cyclone (Anonymous, 2014).  \n \nThe cyclone made a landfall on 12 Oct. 2013 at around 1530 UTC and caused intense \nrain in Orissa during 12-14 Oct 2013. The Figure 3 show the district averaged rain rate \nfrom H-E and a network of rain gauges from the state government of Orissa. A good \nagreement can be observed in rain distribution from H-E and surface observations. \n \nA scatter plot of H-E rain and surface observations from Fig. 3 is shown in Fig. 4. \n \n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 \n8 \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 2: Chronlogical history of rain rates associated with Phaillin cyclone from INSAT-3D based \nHydro-Estimator method. \n    \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 3: Distribution of the district average rain for the Orissa from (a) H-E and (b) surface \nobservations. \n \n(a) \n(b) \n(g) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n(e) \n(f) \n(a) \n(h) \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 \n9 \n \n \n \nFig. 4: Scatter plot of 12-14 Oct 2013 district averaged rain from Orissa from H-E and \nsurface observations. \n \nThe 3-days, 12-14 Oct. 2013, Orissa state averaged rain associated with the Phaillin \ncyclone from INSAT-3D H-E, surface observations, TRMM-3B42RT and CPC is \nprovided in Table 1.    \n \nTable 1: Orissa state averaged rain associated with Phaillin cyclone from 12-14 Oct. \n2013.  \nRain (mm) \nH-E \nSurface Obs. \n3B41RT \nCPC \n125.89 \n110.1 \n60.0 \n180.0 \n \nThus it can be concluded that INSAT-3D H-E rain is not only in a good qualitatively and \nquantitatively agreement with surface observations but it is also having a good \nagreement in its spatial distribution.  \n \nFurther, we have compared weekly meteorological (met) subdivision averaged rain from \nINSAT-3D H-E with corresponding rain values from IMD generated weekly weather \nreports (WWR) and TRMM-3B42RT for 7 weeks from 29 May to 16 July 2014 of the S-\nW monsoon season.  The Fig. 5 shows the inter-comparison of weekly met-subdivision \naveraged rain from H-E, WWR and 3B42RT. \n \nThe Fig. 5 shows a reasonably good agreement of H-E weekly rain with IMD WWR and \nTRMM-3B42RT. To examine the comparison statistics of H-E rain in better perspective, \nwe have provided the comparison of 3B42RT with IMD WWR. It may be recalled that \n3B42RT is an IR and microwave merged product.  \n \nFurther comparison is made between hourly CPC 1oX1o latitude-longitude gridded rain \nwith H-E rain for period from 23-27 October 2013. The comparison statistics is provided \nin Table 2 below. For comparison in smaller spatial and temporal scales, a comparison \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 \n10 \n \nof INSAT-3D H-E with TRMM 3B41RT hourly rain in 0.25oX0.25o latitude-longitude grid \nis made for period 20-24 Sep 2014. The TRMM 3B41RT is a microwave derived rain \nproduct and is available hourly.   \n \n \n \n \nFig. 5: Comparison of weekly meteteorological sub-division averaged rain for 7 weeks \nfrom 29 May to 16 July 2014  between (a) IMD WWR and H-E rain, (b) TRMM-\n3B42RT and H-E rain, and (c) TRMM 3B42RT and IMD WWR.  \n \n \nTable 2:  Comparison statistics of rain from H-E with CPC and 3B41RT \n \nComparison between CPC and INSAT-3D H-E Rain \nPeriod \nTime Scale \nSpatial Grid \nR \nRmsd \nBias \n23-27 Oct 2013 \nDaily \n1oX1o \n0.69 \n17.01 mm \n3.13 mm \nComparison between 3B41RT and INSAT-3D H-E Rain \n20-24 Sep 2014 \nHourly \n0.25oX0.25o \n0.59 \n1.06 mm/h \n0.12 \n \n4.0 Need for further Improvements in Hydro-Estimator \n \nThe results presented in section 3.0 above show a reasonable good agreement \nbetween H-E rain and surface observations. The most of the result presented in the \nabove section are dominated by regions that are either oceans or have moderate \nelevations from the sea level. Figure 6 below shows the comparison of IMD Weekly \nWWR met-subdivision accumulated rain for 7 weeks with corresponding H-E rain \naveraged over 4 typical high orographic met-subdivisions, viz. Arunachal Pradesh (AP), \nUttrakhand (UK), Himachal Pradesh (HP) and Jammu and Kashmir (J & K), \n \nThe Fig. 6 shows that H-E rain estimated for areas with high altitudes is largely \nunderestimated with respect to surface observations. Also, with regard to Fig. 1, as it is \nalready mentioned in section 3.0 that the rain over Himalayan region is not well depicted \nby H-E rain from INSAT-3D as well as that provided by NOAA using Meteosat. In view \nof the observed underestimation of the rain by H-E in the present form over high altitude \nregions, it is desired to investigate its possible reason and accordingly modify the H-E \nmethod to make it able to better represent the rain over high altitudes.  \n \n(b) \n(c) \n(a) \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 \n11 \n \n \nFig. 6: Comparison of IMD weekly rain from WWR with corresponding H-E rain in 4 met \nsubdivisions with high altitudes.  \n \n5.0 Modified Hydro-estimator: \n \nAs discussed the previous section, the H-E is not able to give satisfactory \nmeasurements over high altitudinal regions. This weakness of H-E is noticeable despite \nof the fact that the H-E method is designed with corrections for orography and warm \nrain. Herein we reinvestigated different corrections applied to the H-E method to work \nout procedures to make it better representative of surface observations, especially in \nhigh altitudes. \n \nFig. 7: NCEP GFS model derived (a) TPW and (b) RH for a typical day and time. \n \n Correction of NCEP derived TPW and RH \n \nIt was observed in the NCEP GFS analyzed fields that TPW and RH values are very low \nin the Himalayan region. For example, Fig. 7 shows the TPW (in inch) and RH (in \npercentage) for a typical day and time, which shows very low value over Himalayan \nregion. Such low values of TPW and RH in NCEP GFS fields are observed irrespective \nof date and time of the observation. Such low values are not supportive of the high rain \nrates in H-E method and hence the estimated rain is largely underestimated.  \n \n(a) \n(b) \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 \n12 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 8: Conditional probability distributions using July 2014 NCEP GFS model derived \nfields over Indian region of TPW (inch) at (a) 0000 UTC, (b) 0600 UTC, (c) 1200 \nUTC and (d) 1800 UTC, and RH (percentage) at (e) 0000 UTC, (f) 0600 UTC, (g) \n1200 UTC and (h) 1800 UTC. \n \nIn order to examine, TPW and RH values with respect to altitude, we have plotted \nconditional probability distributions (PDF) of TPW (in inch) and RH (in percentage) \nconditioned to different altitudes over Indian region (i.e., 0-40 N and 65-100 E) from one \nfull month (July 2014) of NCEP GFS analyzed fields separately for each of the \nobservation times (i.e., 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 UTC).  This is shown in Fig. 8. In \nwhich it can be seen that TPW and RH have nearly same PDFs irrespective of time of \nobservation. Also the TPW and RH values are always very low at high altitudes. For \nexample, for altitude above 4000 m, the TPW is always less that 1 inch and RH is \nalways less than 50%. In order to have their values at higher altitudes comparable to \nthat at lower altitudes, we have carried out histogram matching with respect to their \n(b) \n(a) \n(c) \n(d) \n(e) \n(f) \n(g) \n(h) \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 \n13 \n \ncorresponding values between 0-500 m values. By histogram matching we intend to \nmake their probability of occurrence same at all altitudes. The Fig. 9 shows the \ncorresponding PDF values before and after histogram matching. \n \n \n \nFig. 9: Probability distributions at different altitudes with one month of NCEP GFS \nmodel fields at 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 UTC of (a) TPW, (b) TPW after \nhistogram equalization, (c) RH, (d) RH after histogram equalization.   \n \n \nFig. 10: (a) TPW, and (b) RH after applying histogram equalization to values in Fig. 7. \n \n \n(b) \n(a) \n(c) \n(d) \n(b) \n(a) \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 \n14 \n \nFigure 9 (a) and (c) show the conditional PDFs of TPW and RH with all time data from \nFig. 8 and Fig. 9 (b) and (d) show them after carrying out histogram equalization. The \nFig. 9 shows that with histogram equalization the probability of occurrence of TPW and \nRH value is nearly same irrespective of altitude. The correction based on histogram \nequalization (Fig. 9) is applied to TPW and RH values shown in Fig. 7. The modified \nTPW and RH values are provided in Fig. 10. The Fig. 10 looks similar to Fig. 7 except \ncorresponding values over Himalayan region which are now have higher values \ncompared to those in Fig. 7. We expect that this correction in TPW and RH will help \ngetting more representative rain values from H-E. \n \n5.1 Correction of Equilibrium Level / Level of Neutral Buoyancy Computation \n \nThe Equilibrium Level (EL) or Level of Neutral Buoyancy (LNB) is computed by following \na parcel along a saturation adiabat upward (from lifting condensation level) to where the \nparcel temperature becomes equal to the environmental temperature. Strength of the \nconvection is determined by a comparing the temperatures of the convective tops from \nIR measurements with that of EL. This level comes before tropopause for the warm rain. \nThis adjustment was initially developed to enhance rainfall in regions where the \nconvective EL was too low (in height) for very cold cloud tops to develop, but where \nvery heavy precipitation is still possible. \n \nIf equivalent potential temperature of the parcel is e and sateurated equivalent potential \ntemperature of the environment is es, then usually a parcel begins with e <es of the \nenvironment. As the parcel rises, conserving e, it will eventually have a e equal to the \nes of the environment; this is referred as the level of free convection (LFC). As the \nparcel rises above the LFC, it is positively buoyant and will continue to raise until \neventually e is equal to the es of the environment again, this is referred as EL or LNB. \nAbove the LNB the parcel becomes negatively buoyant and tends to return to the LNB. \nAssuming adiabatic ascent, i.e., no mixing of environmental air, we can determine the \nLNB for given sounding.  \n \nConventionally, the e and es are determined considering 1000 mb as the reference \nlevel. We find that by taking 1000 mb as reference the convergence of thermodynamic \nequations above hilly terrain is not always possible, and thereby it does not allow us to \ncarry out correction for warm rain over such regions. Taking cognition of the fact that \n1000 mb is not a realistic level over hilly terrain where surface pressure is often much \nlower. We thus replaced this 1000 mb with surface temperature over hilly terrain in \nthermodynamic equations for e and es. This resulted in more often convergence of \nequations over hilly terrains. Figure 11 (a) shows the EL/LNB as computed using 1000 \nmb as reference surface and Fig. 11 (b) shows the EL/LNB as computed with modified \nalgorithm. One can notice the changes only over some regions (especially, Himalayas, \nHindukush and Arabia) where with modified scheme the computation of LNB is now \npossible. \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 \n15 \n \n \nFig. 11: LNB calculated with Temperature and RH vertical profiles from NCEP GFS \nmodel fields with (a) 1000 mb as reference surface, (b) actual surface pressure.  \n \n5.2 Modification in orographic correction \n \nThe orographic correction uses 850 mb wind speed which is unrealistic level over high \naltitudes. The 850 mb level is considered for avoiding the boundary layer for surface \npressure close to 1000 mb level. For high orographic regions, this needs to be modified \nand replaced with realistic level. This is done in the modified algorithm; we can see the \n850 mb u-wind component on a typical date and time in Fig. 12 (a), and modified wind \ninput to orographic correction in Fig. 12 (b). One can see the moderate changes in the \nwind only over orographic regions. \n \n \nFig. 12: From NCEP model fields (a) Wind Speed at 850 mb (b) Wind Speed above \nboundary layer. \n(b) \n(a) \n(b) \n(a) \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 \n16 \n \n  \nWith above modifications, we examined the capability of H-E for measuring intense rain \nover Himalayas. Few examples are presented in the next section. We have presented a \ndetailed validation of the modified H-E over all the other regions too. \n \n6.0 Validation of Modified Hydro-Estimator \n \nThe above modifications in H-E are aimed at improving rain over orographic regions. \nHence the success of the changes in the H-E depends primarily on its improved \nperformance over Hilly terrain, and its consistent or improved performance over all other \nregions. We have taken two different cases of intense rain over Himalyas which were \npoorly represented by H-E. One is that of flash floods in Uttrakhand from 15-17 June \n2013 which resulted heavy flooding and huge loss of life and property. In June 2013, \nINSAT-3D was not available and hence we applied the modified algorithm to Kalpana-1 \nVHRR observations and examined the performance. Figure 13 shows the rain over \nUttrakhand region in the morning of 17 June 2013 when scores or people were perished \nin Kedarnath, Badrinath and other adjoining regions. The Fig. 13 (a) is H-E rain \nmeasurements without applying modifications and Fig. 13 (b) shows the H-E rain with \nmodifications as described in section 5.0. We can see the mark difference in the rain \nintensity with corrections. \n \nFig. 13: H-E rain in Uttrakhand on 17 June 2013 at 0200 UTC (0730 IST) (a) without \nmodifications, (b) with modifications.  \n \n \nThe Fig. 14 (a) show the weekly averaged 13-19 June 2013 district rain from modified \nH-E. The state averaged rain from H-E is 316 mm. The Fig. 14 (b) is weekly averaged \nrain map for the same week from IMD WWR, which shows a value of 322.9 mm for the \nstate of Uttrakhand. Thus, H-E with modifications provided in section 5.0 is able to give \na very close to realistic weekly rain values over Uttrakhand. \n \n \n \n(b) \n(a) \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 \n17 \n \nState Average from modified H-E: 316 mm \n \nState Average from IMD WWR: 322 mm \n \nFig. 14: Averaged rain for a week from 13-19  June 2013 (a) district averaged from \nmodified H-E, (b) IMD Weekly Weather Report. \n \nThe other case of intense rain over Himalayan regions that is presented here is that of \nintense rain and floods in Jammu and Kashmir during 3-5 September 2014.  Figure 15 \n(a) shows the rain from INSAT-3D H-E on 04 September 2014 at 1500 hr without \napplying modifications. It can be observed that modified H-E is able to capture very \nintense rain in the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) region (Fig. 15 (b)), which otherwise it is \nnot able to capture in Fig. 15(a).  \n \n \nFig. 15: Rain on 04 September 2014 at 1500 UTC from (a) without modification, and (b) \nwith modification. \n \nThe J&K state averaged H-E rain from modified algorithm for week from 3-10 \nSeptember 2014 is found to be of 245.78 mm which is very close to the IMD WWR \nprovided rain of 267.7 mm. For the same week TRMM-3B42 V7 provides corresponding \nrain value of 95.33 mm. Thus the H-E rain from modified algorithm is better \nrepresentative of intense rain in J&K during 3-10 September 2014 then TRMM 3B42 V7.  \n(b) \n(a) \n(b) \n(a) \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 \n18 \n \n \nThe above two case studies of very intense rain over hilly terrain gives us confidence \nthat the modifications in H-E method as described in section 5.0, give more \nrepresentative rain values over Hilly terrain. \n \nFurther validations are carried out of the modified algorithm in different spatial and \ntemporal scales with IMD daily gridded, weekly met-subdivision averaged (from WWR) \nrain values, and also with TRMM 3B42 V7, which is an IR and microwave merged \nproduct.   \n \nWe have computed the H-E rain from modified algorithm for 10 week period from 3 July \nto 10 September 2014.  The rain values are averaged in met-subdivisions on weekly \nbasis and compared with rain values provided by IMD in WWR. A scatter plot of \ncomparison is shown in Fig. 16. \n \n \nFig. 16: Comparison of weekly meteorological subdivision averaged rain from H-E and \nIMD WWR for 10 weeks from 3 July to 10 September 2014.  \n \nThe Fig. 16 when compared with Fig. 5 (a), shows a marked improvement in the \ncomparison of H-E rain with WWR rain values, both in terms of correlation as well as \nstandard deviation of their difference. This is despite of the fact that range of the rain \nvalues plotted in Fig. 16 is higher compared to that in Fig. 5 (a).  \n \nThe Fig. 16 provides statistics of comparison for all the 10 weeks of comparison, the \nweek-by-week comparison statistics is provided in Table 3 below. \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 \n19 \n \n \nTable 3: Week-by-Week comparison statistics of weekly meteorological subdivision \naveraged H-E rain with IMD WWR. \n \nWeek ending on \nHE Vs IMD WWR \nR       \nErr     \nBias \n9 July 2014 \n0.80 \n40.93 \n20.29 \n16 July 2014 \n0.74 \n86.62 \n47.98 \n23 July 2014 \n0.64 \n92.46 \n43.11 \n30 July 2014 \n0.87 \n36.44 \n15.29 \n06 Augt 2014 \n0.89 \n60.09 \n27.02 \n13 Augt 2014 \n0.74 \n37.03 \n-2.88 \n20 Augt 2014 \n0.81 \n49.74 \n18.37 \n27 Augt 2014 \n0.81 \n47.38 \n24.96 \n03 Sept 2014 \n0.72 \n58.64 \n19.92 \n10 sep 2014 \n0.90 \n25.70 \n-1.44 \nAll 10 weeks \n0.78 \n46.64  \n21.26 \n \nThe Table 3 shows a highest correlation between H-E rain WWR rain of 0.90 for a week \nfrom 4 to 10 September 2014 and lowest correlation of 0.64 for a week from 10 to 16 \nJuly 2014. In order to see the comparison results in better perspectives, we have also \nused TRMM 3B42 V7 observations and compared their weekly met-subdivision \naveraged values with corresponding H-E and WWR rain values. This is shown in Table \n4 below. \n \nTable 4: Week-by-Week comparison statistics of weekly meteorological subdivision \naveraged 3B42 V7 rain with IMD WWR and H-E rain. \n \nWeek ending on \n3B42 vs WWR  \n3B42 Vs HE  \nR  \nErr  \nBias  \nR  \nErr  \nBias  \n9 July 2014 \n0.53 \n57.24 \n0.32 \n0.49 \n70.94 \n-19.59 \n16 July 2014 \n0.91 \n58.67 \n-18.63 \n0.91 \n81.48 \n-45.65 \n23 July 2014 \n0.82 \n23.98 \n1.94 \n0.86 \n40.23 \n-18.35 \n30 July 2014 \n0.61 \n45.63 \n-4.66 \n0.48 \n44.90 \n-3.22 \n06 Augt 2014 \n0.52 \n50.53 \n-17.23 \n0.63 \n38.00 \n-14.34 \n13 Augt 2014 \n0.92 \n49.09 \n1.66 \n0.86 \n68.90 \n-46.32 \n20 Augt 2014 \n0.82 \n30.17 \n-7.46 \n0.87 \n53.34 \n-25.83 \n27 Augt 2014 \n0.82 \n43.01 \n-5.20 \n0.61 \n97.40 \n-48.31 \n03 Sept 2014 \n0.77 \n51.67 \n22.68 \n0.92 \n29.32 \n-2.28 \n10 sep 2014 \n0.93 \n24.83 \n-8.11 \n0.88 \n39.21 \n-23.40 \nAll 10 weeks \n0.78 \n45.15 \n-3.47 \n0.76 \n60.19 \n-24.73 \n \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 \n20 \n \nIf we compare Table 3 and 4, we may conclude that overall (with all 10 weeks of \ndataset) correlation of WWR with H-E is same as that with TRMM 3B42 V7. The rms \ndifference of WWR with H-E is also very close to that with TRMM 3B42 V7. Despite of \nthese similarities, there is remarkable difference between these 2 comparisons, that is, \nthe correlation between H-E and WWR varies from moderate a range of 0.64 to 0.90, \nwhereas that between TRMM 3B42 V7 and WWR varies from low value of 0.52 to high \nvalue of 0.93. Thus statistics between H-E and WWR is more stable compared to that \nbetween TRMM 3B42 V7 and WWR. The comparison between TRMM 3B42 V7 and H-\nE is also attempted and is shown in the Table 4.  \n \nIt may be recalled that 3B42 V7 is from state-of-art algorithm that combines IR and \nMicrowave Measurements and adjust the biases with surface observations. Despite of \nthese facts, H-E results are comparable (or even better) to that of 3B42 V7 \nmeasurements. In order to see that how modified H-E measurements compare with only \nMicrowave measurements of precipitation, we compared 2 weeks (3 – 16 July 2014) of \nweekly met-subdivisions averaged H-E rain with TRMM 3B41RT. The comparison \nresults are shown in Table 5 below. The comparison shows poorer correlation between \n3B41 and WWR that that between H-E and WWR. Thus, modified H-E rain is having a \nbetter representation of the surface observations than that by only microwave based \nrain rates from TRMM 3B41RT. \n \nTable 5: Week-by-Week comparison statistics of weekly meteorological subdivision \naveraged rain from 3B41RT with H-E rain with WWR and IMD. \n \nWeek ending on \n3B41 vs WWR  \n3B41 Vs HE  \nR  \nErr  \nBias  \nR  \nErr  \nBias  \n9 July 2014 \n0.66  \n47.46  \n24.88 \n0.81  \n34.75  \n4.58 \n16 July 2014 \n0.56  \n88.98  \n23.69 \n0.78  \n65.72  \n-24.29 \nAll 2 weeks  \n0.58  \n71.31  \n24.28 \n0.80  \n52.56  \n-9.86 \n \nWe are also obtained 0.25ox0.25o daily gridded surface rain measurements from IMD. \nBefore using them for further comparisons in finer spatial and temporal scales, we \nexamined their integrity vis-à-vis rain values provided in WWR. We averaged gridded \nrain values and generated weekly rain maps similar to those provided in WWR. The \ncomparison statistics of IMD gridded dataset with WWR is provided in Table 6 below: \n \nTable 6: Comparison statistics of weekly meteorological subdivision averaged \n0.25ox0.25o daily gridded surface rain measurements from IMD with WWR. \n \n \nIMD daily grided data versus IMD Weekly Weather Report  \nAll 10 Weeks  \nR = 0.97    \nrmse = 16.36    \nBias = -0.37  \n \nWe expect a near perfect comparison between IMD gridded data and IMD WWR but \nthere exists marked difference between them.  \n \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 \n21 \n \nThe Table 3 shows the comparison between rain values from modified H-E and WWR, \nbut that does not give any indication of performance of H-E in different meteorological \nsub-divisions. In Table 7, we have made comparison in different subdivisions and \npresented the statics. Herein comparison over Lakshadweep is not provided as that is \nconsidered to represent maritime environment. It can be observed that high correlation \nexist in all the subdivisions except in Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya and Tripura \n(NMMT) and Coastal AP, which needs further investigation.  Similar comparison \nbetween 3B42 V7 and modified H-E is also attempted, which is shown in Table 8. From \nTable 8, it can be observed that the correlation of modified H-E rain with 3B42 V7 over \nNMMT and Coastal Andhra Pradesh (AP) is 0.32 and 0.64 which is not as poor as in \nTable 7.  Thus any study to understand large difference in these two met subdivisions in \nTable 7 needs to take cognition of this fact that the 3B42 V7 and H-E are uniformly \nmeasured spatially averaged measurements. The coarser correlation as observed in \nTable 7 in NMMT and Coastal AP may be due to high variability of precipitation in these \nregions associated with geolocation error in the INSAT-3D observations (mean error of \n1-2 pixel error is possible) which may show poorer comparison with surface \nobservations taken at fixed locations (Piyush et al., 2012). Other than these two regions \nthe correlation between rain from modified H-E and WWR is reasonably good, \nespecially in the regions with high altitudes like J & K, Arunachal Pradesh, Uttrakhand \nand Himachal Pradesh, etc. \n \nTable 7: Comparison statistics of weekly averaged rain from H-E and WWR in each met \nsubdivisions. \n \nMet Sub Division R \nrmse  bias \nMet Sub Division \nR \nrmse  bias \nA & N \n0.48 75.60 \n-55.50 West MP \n0.63 74.80 -33.61 \nArunachal Pradesh 0.73 63.23 \n-32.03 East MP \n0.71 94.62 -58.28 \nAssam & Megha. \n0.69 49.90 \n-37.88 Guj, DNH & Dam. \n0.76 40.61 10.15 \nNMMT \n-0.07 61.06 \n-37.03 Saur., Katch & Diu \n0.89 13.92 1.21 \nSHWB \n0.35 53.47 \n-0.99 \nKonkan & Goa \n0.62 138.24 92.14 \nGangetic WB \n0.57 73.65 \n-17.54 Madhya Maha \n0.81 69.72 -48.06 \nOrissa \n0.94 37.25 \n-30.85 Marathwada \n0.71 64.50 -44.66 \nJharkhand \n0.75 67.34 \n-52.02 Vidarbh \n0.86 44.42 -26.58 \nBihar \n0.94 29.23 \n-19.52 Chattisgarh \n0.91 48.28 -33.79 \nEast UP \n0.89 39.61 \n-28.65 Coastal AP \n0.22 41.64 -33.33 \nWest UP \n0.87 28.32 \n-20.28 Telengana \n0.72 33.99 -23.12 \nUttrakhand  \n0.84 43.35 \n-19.98 Rayalaseema \n0.89 13.44 -10.87 \nHR., Chd. & Delhi \n0.61 16.55 \n-8.77 \nTN & Pondicherry \n0.73 20.36 -16.96 \nPunjab \n0.97 10.42 \n-4.65 \nCoastal Karnataka \n0.82 129.69 -60.61 \nHP \n0.72 34.71 \n-21.01 N.I.

In shorter measuring scales, it behaves as quasi-random \nstochastic process. Therefore, rain comparisons in shorter time scales and from \nobservations in different spatial scales lead to large errors (Piyush et al., 2012). \nNevertheless, we have compared daily 0.25ox0.25o averaged rain from modified H-E \nmethod with gridded dataset from IMD.

The \ndifference may be due to geolocation error is INSAT-3D which is suspected to have \nmean error of 1-2 pixels in geolocation due to anomaly in the star sensor, which has \npotential to degrade statistics in smaller scales. \n \nTable 10: Comparison statistics of 0.25ox0.25o daily gridded rain from H-E and IMD in \neach met subdivisions. \n \nMet Sub Division R \nrmse  bias \nMet Sub Division \nR \nrmse  bias \nArunachal Pradesh 0.26   43.63    -5.87 \nEast MP \n0.45   30.11   -7.24 \nAssam & Megha. \n0.52   46.41    -3.34 \nGuj, DNH & Dam. \n0.42   19.02   1.66 \nNMMT \n0.17   28.77    -6.89 \nSaur., Katch & Diu \n0.39   13.54   0.43 \nSHWB \n0.22   38.85    0.84 \nKonkan & Goa \n0.44   43.31   8.26 \nGangetic WB \n0.41   23.45    -4.51 \nMadhya Maha \n0.39   34.42   -7.83 \nOrissa \n0.51   31.85    -5.05 \nMarathwada \n0.46   27.38   -6.36 \nJharkhand \n0.57   26.48    -8.14 \nVidarbh \n0.57   23.43   -3.93 \nBihar \n0.63   18.70    -2.30 \nChattisgarh \n0.61   26.18   -5.55 \nEast UP \n0.56   20.82    -4.61 \nCoastal AP \n0.32   25.28   -4.64 \nWest UP \n0.45   16.03    -2.86 \nTelengana \n0.40   18.04   -2.77 \nUttrakhand  \n0.36   34.28    -3.33 \nRayalaseema \n0.51   9.15    -1.17 \nHR., Chd. & Delhi \n0.39   10.43    -1.25 \nTN & Pondicherry \n0.34   12.65   -2.46 \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 \n24 \n \nPunjab \n0.45   9.16     0.21 \nCoastal Karnataka \n0.51   47.31   -3.04 \nHP \n0.30   31.83    -2.97 \nN.I.

This is mainly due to spatially averaged \nmeasurement of rain from H-E and TRMM TRMM-3B42 V7. The Table 12 also shows \nthe performance of modified H-E with respect to TRMM 3B42 V7 over oceans. It may be \nnoted here that neither IMD WWR nor gridded dataset has provides measurements \nover oceans. So the comparison with TRMM 3B42 V7 is the only source for accessing \nthe quality of H-E rain over oceans. It may be noted from Table 12 that daily 0.25ox0.25o \ngridded rain from H-E and 3B42 RT has a good agreement over oceans with correlation \nof 0.65 and rmse of 15.88 mm/day. If all area including land and oceans including and \nsurrounding India are taken into consideration, the correlation and rmse between H-E \nand TRMM-3B42 V7  is 0.59 and rmsd of 22.44 mm/day. \n \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 \n25 \n \nTable 12: Comparison statistics of 0.25ox0.25o daily gridded rain from H-E and TRMM \n3B42 V7 in each met subdivisions. \n \nMet Sub Division R \nrmse  bias \nMet Sub Division \nR \nrmse  bias \nArunachal Pradesh 0.51   37.82    9.11 \nGuj, DNH & Dam. \n0.58   20.43   -2.42 \nAssam & Megha. \n0.61   40.53    3.55 \nSaur., Katch & Diu \n0.66   14.67   -2.04 \nNMMT \n0.39   25.09    4.31 \nKonkan & Goa \n0.67   34.83   0.68 \nSHWB \n0.37   34.26    2.61 \nMadhya Maha \n0.71   26.84   5.59 \nGangetic WB \n0.57   20.69    3.89 \nMarathwada \n0.71   21.00   3.29 \nOrissa \n0.57   30.05    4.69 \nVidarbh \n0.73   19.33   3.05 \nJharkhand \n0.62   25.59    7.93 \nChattisgarh \n0.66   24.44   6.25 \nBihar \n0.68   16.77    2.75 \nCoastal AP \n0.53   22.76   3.33 \nEast UP \n0.73   16.74    2.22 \nTelengana \n0.55   15.78   2.24 \nWest UP \n0.59   14.08    0.91 \nRayalaseema \n0.60   8.27     0.32 \nUttrakhand  \n0.50   31.89    4.83 \nTN & Pondicherry \n0.48   11.47   1.15 \nHR., Chd. & Delhi \n0.45   10.53    0.17 \nCoastal Karnataka \n0.49   49.59   13.70 \nPunjab \n0.47   8.46    -0.63 \nN.I.

The changes that are carried out in the modified algorithm \nare able to successfully represent the orographic rain which otherwise was not found to \nsuffer from huge errors. The rain is highly variable parameter over space and time and \nits validation in smaller scales always resulting large huge errors (Piyush et al., 2012). \nThe results presented above should be viewed with respect to validation comparison \nresults of the global standard rain products by other researchers. For example, in a \nrecent study by Tan et al. (2015) in which they evaluated six high resolution \nprecipitation products including TRMM-3B42 V7 over the Malaysia. They reported that \namong 5 satellite based rain products, the 3B42 V7 and is the best performing with \nrespect to surface observations, which on daily scale provides a correlation of 0.39 and \nrmse of 18.35 mm/day. While the India has much more diverse surface and climatic \nconditions with different cloud types and wide range of precipitation rates during S-W \nmonths, we achieve much higher correlation between modified H-E rain with surface \nobservations. A more important aspect of the rain from H-E vis-à-vis TRMM 3B42 V7 is \ntimely availability of H-E product from IMD and MOSDAC sites. The TRMM 3B42 V7 is \navailable after latency of about 4 months, whereas INSAT-3D H-E is available within 15 \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 \n26 \n \nminutes of data acquisition, which makes H-E very important for operational users, \nespecially those working with rain related natural disasters, nowcasting and numerical \nweather predictions. \n \nBased on above analysis, we can summarize the results as follows: \n \n1.  H-E in the present form performs well over most parts of land and oceans but \nhas found to have weakness over high altitude regions. \n2. The weakness of the H-E in high altitude areas is successfully addressed in \nmodified H-E.   \n3. On weekly and met-subdivision scale, the modified H-E provides a correlation of \n0.78 and rms difference of 46.64 mm with surface observations from IMD weekly \nWeather Report (WWR).  \n4. On weekly and met-subdivision scale, the modified H-E provides a correlation of \n0.78 and rms difference of 45.15 mm with TRMM 3B42 V7.  \n5. It is found that comparison statistics between modified H-E and WWR is \ncomparable to that between TRMM-3B42 V7 and WWR.  However, week-by-\nweek variation in the comparison statistics of H-E versus WWR is more stable \nthan that between TRMM 3B42 V7 and WWR. \n6. Daily 0.25ox0.25o gridded rain from modified H-E matches well with surface \ngridded observations over land with correlation of 0.47 and rms difference of \n25.40 mm/day. Slightly higher correlation of 0.59 and rms of 22.40 difference \nmm/day is observed when H-E rain is compared with TRMM 3B42 V7. The \nresults are in tune with comparison between 3B42 V7 with surface observations. \n7.  The comparison over oceans is not possible with IMD gridded surface \nobservations hence comparison is done with daily 0.25ox0.25o gridded rain for \nmodified H-E and TRMM 3B42 V7 and that show a correlation of 0.65 and rms \ndifference of 15.88 mm/h. \n8. The H-E rain shows a good comparison in all the met subdivisions except in \n“Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya and Tripura (NMMT)” and “Coastal Andhara \nPradesh”, which are also poorly comparable with TRMM 3B42 V7. The reason \nneeds to be further investigated. \n9. Over all, rain from modified H-E is comparable to TRMM 3B42 V7 with an \nadvantage of near real time availability of measurements (within 30 minutes) \ncompared to 4 months for the availability of TRMM 3B42 V7 product. \n \nThe modified H-E is soon going to be made operational both at SAC and MOSDAC \nsites. A “Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document” is presently under preparation.    \n \n \n8.0 Implementation Steps \n \nThe modified H-E is already implemented offline and running flawlessly. The present \noperational structure of H-E module comprising of two main programs called HEM and \nHEG. The HEM takes Earth elevation model (ETOPO2) as static data input and NCEP \nGFS model file as dynamic input and provides the correction files for equilibrium level, \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 \n27 \n \norography, TPW and RH. The HEM uses three separate programs as subroutines for \norographic correction, wind interpolation and a atmospheric thermodynamic model for \nthe calculation of LNB/EL.  The HEG takes INSAT-3D level1 files as input along with \ncorrection files to produce the rain at every pixel within the study area. This is illustrated \nin flow chart 1 (Fig. 17). In the modified scheme, new HEM removes the program for \natmospheric thermo dynamics and includes the necessary model equations in the main \nbody of HEM itself. The modified HEM also takes histogram equalization matched up \nfiles for each of the height bins of the parameter (TPW/RH) at surface to given elevation \nbin as static input files. The only change in input to HEG is that in modified program for \nH-E rain, it also takes as input to Earth elevation model file (ETOPO2).This is shown in \nFig. 18.  \n \nFig. 17: Flow chart showing present structure of H-E module. \n \n \n \nFig. 18: Flow chart showing modifiled structure of H-E module. \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 \n28 \n \n9.0 Domain and the format of output \n \nThe output is provided in terms of geolocation (latitude and longitude) and rain rate in \nmm/h. \n \nThe area of coverage is latitude: 30oE to 130o E, and longitude: 50o S to 50o N.  \n \n10.0 Acknowledgement \n \nAuthors are thankful to Dr. Robert Koligowaski, NOAA/STAR for his unconditional \nsupport to develop H-E at SAC.  \n \n \n \nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015 \n29 \n \n11.0 References \n \nAnonymous, 2014, Tropical Cyclone Phailin – Prediction, Monitoring and Analysis of \nAftereffects, Report # SAC/EPSA/SR-01/2014, Pub. by EPSA/SAC, ISRO, \nahmedabad, p 200. \nArkin, P A, A V R Krishna Rao, RR Kelker, 1986, Large scale precipitation and outgoing \nlongwave radiation from INSAT-1B during 1986 South-West Monsoon, Season, \nJournal of Climate, 2, 619-628. \nBarrett, E. c., and D.

Aerosols have large-\nscale effects, such as their impact on climate by redistributing solar radiation (Herman \nand Browning 1975; Charlson et al. 1991; Haywood and Boucher 2000) and interacting \nwith clouds (Platnick and Twomey 1994; Kaufman et al. 2002). Aerosol information is \nalso critical for atmospheric correction algorithms for multi-spectral satellite sensors and \nmilitary operations. The climate effects of atmospheric aerosols may be comparable to \nCO2 greenhouse effects, but with opposite sign and larger uncertainty (Hansen and Lacis, \n1990). Aerosols have a significant impact on human life beyond the climate element. \nWhen in the lower troposphere, aerosols cause poor air quality, reduction of visibility, \nand public health hazards. Satellite remote sensing provides a means to derive aerosol \ndistribution at global and regional scales.  \nThis Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) describes the updated algorithm \nused to retrieve the Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOD) for the INSAT-3D/3DR Imager \ninstrument operating from a geostationary platform. In comparison to previous algorithm \n(see INSAT-3D AOD ATBD version-1&2), the present algorithm (version-3, Mishra et \nal, 2018) is significantly different both in terms of surface reflectance characterization as \nwell as aerosol inversion. The updated algorithm has several advancement, which has \nimproved the AOD product. Following points are some of the important features of the \npresent algorithm that makes it advanced and improved in comparison to previous \nversions: \na) Previous algorithm utilizes single scattering approximation (SSA) that is it do not \nconsider multiple scattering, while in present algorithm exact radiative transfer \ncalculation are done considering multiple scattering events also. \nAerosol  \nb) In previous versions, minimization of 30-day top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiance is \nassumed as surface contribution, while here minimization of Rayleigh corrected TOA \nreflectance is used for generating clear composite image (CCI). \nc) In previous version CCI image is directly used as surface reflectance, while in present \nalgorithm CCI image is first atmospherically corrected using dynamic (seasonal and \nspatial) background aerosol database (generated using multiyear MODIS aqua AOD data) \nto generate surface reflectance which is then used for AOD inversion. \nd) Previously perfectly scattering aerosol type is assumed for both ocean and land (for \nland it is rarely valid), while in updated algorithm for AOD inversion continental and \nmarine aerosols are used for land and ocean, respectively. \ne) In previous versions, AOD retrieval done for all pixel even over bright surface where \nin principle retrieval is not possible using band centered at red (650nm) wavelength, \nwhile in current version AOD retrieval is done only for those pixel where surface \nreflectance is less than critical reflectance. Thus, false retrievals such as AOD retrieval \nover very bright surface (like desert or bare arid soil surfaces or high reflecting urban \nsetups) are reduced/masked. \nf) Current algorithm gives AOD product at 550 nm. \nThe output product description is summarized in Table 1. Specifically, this document \nidentifies the sources of input data, both INSAT-3D/3DR imager and non- INSAT-\n3D/3DR imager data, required for retrieval; provides the physical theory and \nmathematical background underlying the use of this information in the retrievals; \nincludes implementation details; and describes assumptions and limitations of the \nproposed approach.  \n \nTable 1: Summary of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) product \nParameter \nName  \nUnits  \nHorizontal Cell \nSize  \nComments  \nAerosol Optical \ndepth at 550 nm  \nDimensionless  10.0 km for both \nLand and oceans  \nRetrieved for all cloud free \nregions.  \n \n \n10.2.2 Objective \nThe objective of this algorithm is to calculate the aerosol optical thickness, proportional \nto the total aerosol loading of the ambient aerosol, over both land and ocean for Indian \nregion on a six times (6:00, 6:30, 7:00, 7:30, 8:00 and 8:30 UTC) daily basis.

Thus, satellite reflectance measurement limited to one (GOES) or two channels \n(Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer [AVHRR]) were used first to derive the \ntotal aerosol content by assuming a given aerosol model.  \nThe relatively homogeneous surface of the ocean enables the direct application of the \nlook up table (LUT) approach to find the aerosol optical thickness. Using the observed \nreflectance at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) in coordination with ancillary information \non the wind speed, water vapor, surface pressure, surface elevation, and ozone, the \ncorrected reflectances are inverted into a maritime LUT to find values of optical \nthickness. \nThe approach over land is more complicated, in that dark, vegetated surfaces are required \nfor aerosol optical depth retrieval. In dark vegetation approach for aerosol retrieval a \nnear-IR band is used to identify dark, vegetated pixels, then the surface reflectance in the \nvisible bands is calculated from the observed reflectance in the near-IR band. The optical \nthickness is initially calculated assuming a continental aerosol model. The suspended \nmatter information is used to choose a better aerosol model and more accurate values of \noptical thickness (Kaufmann et al. 1997). \nIn spite of advances in aerosol remote sensing over land, most retrievals are limited to \nonce or twice per day, as by the morning and afternoon passes of the orbiting polar \nsatellites. Aerosols, however, show diurnal variations that would be missed by such \nsparse observations. While studies of aerosol optical depth from Sun photometers show \nlittle systematic trends (Smirnov et al. 2002), surface observations of scattering show \nsignificant diurnal patterns (Bergin et al. 2001). It is required to understand aerosol plume \nmovement to track and forecast plume movement in the interest of human health. \nTherefore, it is important to monitor the temporal aspects of aerosol. \nThe INSAT-3DR imager data from geostationary platform has the potential to provide \naerosol observations over land and ocean with multiple observations per day.  Many \nstudies have demonstrated the potential of Geostationary Operational Environmental \nSatellite (GOES) series of imager sensors to provide quantitative estimates of aerosol \noptical (Knapp et al. 2002, Knapp et al. 2005). Their sensitivity studies, however, \nconcluded that retrievals depend on aerosol optical property assumptions and surface \nreflectance. Studies using newer geostationary satellites (e.g. GOES-8) and larger \nvalidation networks (e.g. Aerosol Robotic Network—AERONET) supported those initial \nAerosol  \nfindings. Specifically, Zhang et al. (2001) and Knapp et al. (2002) showed that aerosol \nmonitoring from GOES is possible for South America. However, this region has optimal \nretrieval conditions: surface cover with little variability (i.e. rainforest) and large aerosol \noptical depths (from biomass burning). \nStudies by Knapp et al. (2005) have shown operational potential of GOES series of \nsensors for the monitoring of aerosol optical depth over land. A method is proposed by \nKnapp et al (2005) to correct surface effects and retrieve aerosol optical depth using \nvisible reflectance measurements from the Geostationary Operational Environmental \nSatellite (GOES). The surface contribution is determined from temporal compositing of \nvisible imagery, where darker pixels correspond to less atmospheric attenuation and \nsurface reflectance is deduced from the composite using radiative transfer. The method is \napplied to GOES-8 imagery over the eastern US. Retrieved surface reflectance is \ncompared with separate retrievals using a priori ground based observations of aerosol \noptical depth. \n10.4.1.1 \nTheoretical Background \nThe INSAT-3DR imager data will be used to perform the surface reflectance and aerosol \noptical depth retrievals and mask for clouds. It measures top of the atmosphere (TOA) \nradiance in six channels: three at infrared wavelengths, one in the visible wavelength and \none sensitive to both solar and Earth-emitted radiance. Primarily, the visible channel \n(0.52–0.72 mm full width at half maximum) is sensitive to aerosol scattering and \nremaining channels are used for cloud masking. The cloud mask algorithm is based on \nthe Clouds from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) (CLAVR) \nalgorithm (Stowe et al. 1999) which uses spectral and spatial thresholds to test for the \npresence of clouds. \nThe retrieval of aerosol information from INSAT-3DR imager data is a 3-step process: \n1)  Cloud masking  \n2) Composite the visible images to estimate the surface reflectance, and \n3) Use the surface reflectance with an image to retrieve the aerosol optical depth.   \nThese steps are described below. \n \nCloud Masking of INSAT-3DR Imager data  \nClouds are generally characterized by higher reflectance and lower temperature than the \nunderlying earth surface. As such, simple visible and infrared window threshold \napproaches offer considerable skill in cloud detection. Following threshold-based tests \nwill be performed to detect the cloudy pixels.  \na) Visible band threshold test  \nThe reflectance threshold test using visible band of INSTA-3D/3DR. Pixels with visible \nchannel reflectance greater than 0.3 over land and greater than 0.10 over ocean are \nconsidered cloudy. \nb) TIR Brightness temperature threshold test \nAerosol  \n Pixels with brightness temperature in TIR1 channel less than 273 are considered cloudy.  \nc) Standard deviation threshold test \nLand: 3X3 pixel window is considered for calculating standard deviation in visible and \nTIR1 channel. If standard deviation of visible channel and TIR1 BT is greater than 0.03 \nand 4, respectively than all pixels in 3X3 window are masked. \nOcean: 3X3 pixel window is considered for calculating standard deviation in visible and \nTIR1 channel. If standard deviation of visible channel and TIR1 BT is greater than 0.015 \nand 1, respectively, than all pixels in 3X3 window are masked. \n \nSurface Reflectance Retrieval \nEstimating the surface contribution to the TOA INSAT-3D/3DR Imager visible \nreflectance is difficult since observations will have atmospheric contamination. For \ninstance, a visible observation from INSAT-3DR Imager on a cloudless day with low \naerosol burden will still have gaseous absorption (primarily, ozone and water vapour); \nRayleigh scattering; and residual aerosol extinction. This atmospheric component to the \nTOA reflectance needs to be removed to retrieve the surface reflectance. While studies \nhave shown it is possible to estimate the surface component from observations in the near \ninfrared (e.g. 2.1 µm) where aerosol and Rayleigh scattering are very low (Kaufman et al. \n2002), the INSAT-3D/3DR imager lacks an observation at this wavelength. Therefore, a \ncompositing method will be used to estimate the surface reflectance. \nThe INSAT-3D/3DR visible channel radiance is converted to top of the atmosphere \n(TOA) reflectance. TOA reflectance is then corrected for ozone and water Vapor \nabsorption. Water vapour and ozone concentration are used from NCEP model data. \nFurther Rayleigh reflectance is removed from the gaseous absorption corrected TOA \nreflectance to get Rayleigh corrected reflectance. This reflectance has aerosol and surface \ncontribution only. Now for each pixel, the 30 day previous Rayleigh corrected reflectance \nis sorted and first and second minima is computed. First minima represent the clearest \ncondition, however, due to cloud shadow contamination, sometimes first minima may not \nbe the true representative of surface reflectance, therefore to remove shadow effect, and \nwe put a threshold test on first minima. If first minima are less than 0.04 then second \nminima will be considered otherwise first minima is considered. The threshold of 0.04 on \nfirst minimum to avoid shadow effect is empirical. This sorting of Rayleigh corrected \nreflectance and selection of first or second minima is done for all pixel to obtain clear \ncomposite image. By using this value to obtain the surface reflectance, one assumes that \naerosol would increase the reflectance and cloud shadows will be rare. The length of the \ntime is somewhat subjective. In general, a long enough time is needed for at least one \ncloud-free observation. Knapp et al. (2005) used a two week (i.e., 14 day) period. The \nclear composite reflectance is then corrected for background aerosol optical depth (0.02 \nand 0.04 for ocean and land respectively) to estimate Lambertian surface reflectance \n(ρsurf). The image in figure (1) shows Lambartian surface reflectance computed using \nabove mentioned method from INSAT-3D data from 4-31 December, 2013 and 4-31 \nJanuary 2014 which is used for aerosol inversion on 1 January 2014 and 1 February 2014, \nrespectively. \nAerosol  \n     \n  \n \n \nFigure 1. Shows Lambartian surface reflectance derived from clear composite method \nusing INSAT-3D visible channel data (a) derived from data for the period of 4-31 \nDecember 2013. (b) Derived from data for the period of 4-31 January 2013. \n \nThe accuracy of the composite depends on the length of time used to create it. For \ninstance, enough cloud-free observations must exist with little aerosol influence for the \nsurface reflectance to be accurate. Areas of persistent aerosol or cloud cover will be \nlikely to have caused errors in the retrieved surface reflectance because the atmospheric \ncomponent remains large in such situations. It is to be noted that in previous version of \nAOD retrieval algorithm (version1 an d 2), instead of minimizing Rayleigh corrected \nreflectance, the TOA radiance was minimized, therefore the effect of change in solar \nzenith angle during the period of previous 30 days decreases the accuracy of derived \nsurface reflectance.  \nAerosol Optical Depth Retrieval \nThe aerosol optical depth retrieval is performed using an INSAT-3D/3DR imager visible \nimage and the retrieved surface reflectance (from the previous step). In this retrieval, the \ncurrent day TOA reflectance is corrected for ozone and water vapour absorption and also \ncorrected for Rayleigh reflectance. Then precomputed look tables (using 6S radiative \ntransfer model) that consist spherical albedo, reflectance, transmittance as a function of \nsun-sensor geometry and aerosol optical thickness are used to simulate theoretical \nRayleigh corrected reflectance which is then compared with observed Rayleigh corrected \nINSAT-3DR reflectance to obtained aerosol optical depth. It is to noted that over land \ncontinental aerosol model is used while over ocean maritime aerosol model is used. In \nprevious versions of AOD retrival algorithm, single scattering approximation was used \nfor inverting AOD, assuming perfectly scattering aerosol (single scattering albedo \nassumed to be unity).

AeRoNet (Aerosol Robotic Network) is a \nnetwork of ground-based sun-photometers established and maintained by Brent Holben \nof Code 923 of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Tom Eck of Raytheon ITSS. \nThe sun-photometers measure the spectral aerosol optical thickness and sky radiance. In \nIndia 3 Aeronet sites namely Kanpur, Goa and Dharwar are providing systematic in-situ \nAOD measurements.  Data from these sites will be used for validation of INSAT-\n3D/3DR derived AODs. \n      Post-Launch Special Field Experiments \nMany of the present satellite observations are augmented by special field campaigns to \nprovide ground-truth data for the satellite-derived measurements. The INSAT-3D/3DR \nImager derived aerosol optical thickness measurements will be validated using hand-held \nsun-photometer. The details of these campaigns (timing, location, instrumentation, etc.) \nwill be decided later on.  \n       \n \nAerosol  \nPost-Launch Satellite-Based Inter-comparisons \nINSAT-3D/3DR Imager derived aerosol optical depths may be validated by comparing \nthem with aerosol optical depths derived by other satellite sensors, such as MODIS. The \nbasic inter-comparison technique involves three steps: 1) identification of locations where \nboth sensors fly over at nearly the same time; 2) extraction of data for storage in an inter-\ncomparison archive; 3) analysis of the differences between the measurements.  \n10.7 \nTechnical issues (Limitation etc.) \nAccuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the radiation model to simulate the \nsatellite radiances. However, the following limitations of the present study have to be \nkept in mind.  \n(i) Characterization of surface reflectivity is critical of the study. Use of darkest \nobservation for last 28 days provides mean reflectivity. This may also introduce \nsignificant errors in derived AOD, specially for the location with persistent AOD for long \nperiod.  \n(ii) Due to single visible channel aerosol type is to be fixed which is in reality is not a \ngood approximation. This may introduce large errors in retrieved AOD. \n(iii) Over bright surface and high aerosol loadings, TOA reflectance becomes insensitive \nto aerosol therefore; AOD over bright surfaces may have large uncertainty. \n10.8 \nFuture Scope \nIn future algorithms making use of INSAT-3D/3DR imager data for SWIR and MIR \nbands can also be attempted for characterization of surface reflectivity.  \n \n 10.9 References \n1.

Products \n11 \n4.0 INSAT-3DS HDF Files and Images Nomenclature \n \n4.1 Imager Products Nomenclature \n \nAll jpg chips are generated using HDF files; hence the name of jpg files starts with HDF \nfile name (including Version number e.g. V01R00) excluding .h5 extension. For each \nband separate jpg files are created from single HDF file. For IR channels additional BT \nimage are generated with _TEMP added to band jpg files.  \n \nSo from Imager standard product (uniqueId_L1B_STD.h5) 11 chips are generated (6 \nchips for six bands + 4 BT images + one RGB) for each acquisitions. Similarly, for \neach sector six band image chips and one RGB chip is generated. \nIn addition to this for each Geo-physical parameter only one chip file is generated, \nexcept wind Vectors.  \nException: For wind vectors based on time of acquisition VISIBLE wind or MIR wind \ngets generated \n \nNOTE: For FIRE and SMOKE in place of HDF, KML file is generated. \nCorresponding Chip file is also generated. \n \n \nTable 4.1 \nINSAT-3DS IMAGER HDF Products and Images \n \nHDF File Name \nImage File Name \nL1B Products \n(Full Globe Basic Products) \n3SIMG_18SEP2024_0600_L1B_STD_V01R00.h5

Due to currently non-\nfunctioning of MADRAS, the possibility of detection and \nestimation of rain from SAPHIR is explored. The SAPHIR \noperates in 6 frequencies ranging from 183.310.2 to \n183.3111 GHz which are close to water vapor absorption line \nat 183.31 GHz. In the first step, an examination of the rain \neffect on SAPHIR channels is carried out, and the results \nshowed them to be sensitive to the rain. In the second step, a \nrain identification algorithm is attempted, which is based on \naverage rain probability (PR) measured at SAPHIR channels. \nThe effect of false alarm and missing rain is examined and it is \nfound that missing rain over land and ocean is < 0.9 mm/h and \n0.13 mm/h with standard deviation of 0.70 mm/h and 0.54 \nmm/h, respectively, and rain due to false alarm over both land \nand oceans is < 0.9 mm/h. In the third step, a nonlinear rain \nretrieval algorithm is proposed for rain affected pixels, which \nexplains a correlation of 0.70 and rmse of 0.81 mm/h. When \nrain identification and retrieval algorithms are applied together, \nit explains a correlation of 0.68 and rmse of 0.45 mm/h on \ninstantaneous basis. Comparison of rain from SAPHIR with \nTRMM-3B42 on monthly basis indicates a correlation of 0.84 \nand rms difference of 0.09 mm/h. In this report step-by-step \nprocedure in given to make this algorithm operational.   \n10. \nClassification: \nUnrestricted \n11. \nDistribution: \nAll concerned \n \n2\nRain Detection and Measurement from Megha-Tropiques Microwave \nSounder – SAPHIR  \n \n \n1.  Introduction: \n \nIn order to study the tropical convective systems and their dominance in defining the \nenergy and water cycle in the atmosphere, several atmospheric variables like \nprecipitation, surface evaporation, net radiation at the top of the atmosphere, vertical \nprofile of temperature and humidity, etc, play a crucial role, and hence it is imperative to \nmeasure these variables simultaneously. This is planned to be achieved through a joint \nIndo-French collaborative Megha-Tropiques (MT) satellite mission. Megha-Tropiques \nsatellite was launched on 12 October 2011, and is purposely designed to study the \nconvective systems, water cycles and energy exchanges in the tropical atmosphere \nthrough a host of onboard instruments such as Microwave Analysis and Detection of \nRain and Atmospheric Structures (MADRAS), Sondeur Atmosphérique du Profil \nd'Humidité Intertropical par Radiométrie (SAPHIR), Scanner for Radiation Budget \n(ScaRaB) and Radio Occultation Sensor for Atmosphere (ROSA). To facilitate frequent \nobservations over the tropics, the Megha-Tropiques is placed in a low inclination orbit \n(20o) at 867 km altitude that provides the coverage over the global tropical region with \n14 orbits a day and 7 days of repeat cycle.  \n \nThe MADRAS onboard MT is a five-frequency, nine-channel, self-calibrating, microwave \nradiometer that sweeps a swath of ~1700 km in a conical scanning with local incidence \nangle of 53.5o on the surface of the Earth. The specifications of MADRAS are provided \nin Table 1. MADRAS observations are used to operationally derive Total Precipitable \nWater (TPW), Cloud Liquid Water (CLW), and Ocean Surface Wind Speed (OWS) over \noceans, and rain over land and oceans using radiative transfer based approach \ndeveloped by Varma et al. (2011) and a scattering index based approach developed by \nGairola et al. (2011).  The SAPHIR is a six-channel microwave sounder that carries out \ncross track scanning within 50o on both sides of the nadir and thereby providing \nvariable incidence angle and variable pixel size over a swath of ~1700 km. The \nspecifications of SAPHIR are given in Table 2. The SAPHIR that operates at \nfrequencies around water vapor resonance line at 183.31 GHz is designed to provide \nclear-sky profiles of atmospheric humidity. Frequencies near 183.31 GHz show very \nhigh atmospheric absorption and the emitted radiations from the environment reaching \nto the satellite are dominated by contribution from broad atmospheric layers whose \nthickness and mean altitude vary with operating frequency as well as with humidity and \ntemperature in the atmosphere. Using observations from SAPHIR channels, algorithms \nare developed to operationally derive the Atmospheric Humidity profiles (Gohil et al., \n2013, Mathur et al., 2013). \n \nRain is an important atmospheric parameter and is most fundamental to achieve \nscience objectives of the Megha-Tropiques mission.  Keeping this is view, the MADRAS \nonboard MT mission is specifically designed to measure the rain. However, after few \nmonths of successful operation, some anomaly was observed in the MADRAS \n \n3\nobservations due to a suspected electrical interference which resulted in to random \nchannel mixing. A methodology is worked out by the CNES and ISRO Project teams for \nrealignment of the data. With this additional processing, a significant amount of data is \nrecovered. However, another serious anomaly observed in MADARS scan mechanism \nand the MADRAS instrument is declared non-operational on 26 January 2013 (please \nsee, http://smsc.cnes.fr/MEGHAT/GP_actualites.htm). In view of these facts, we herein \nmake an attempt to measure rain from SAPHIR observations which may help fulfilling \nscience objectives of the MT mission in the absence of the MADRAS observations.  \n \nFor rain measurement, passive microwave radiometers operating below 90 GHz \nfrequency (e.g., TMI, SSM/I, AMSR-E, MADRAS, etc.) are commonly used. \nFrequencies above 90 GHz are available on number of sensors like SSMIS, SSM/T 2 \n(Special Sensor Microwave Temperature 2) onboard DMSP satellite, AMSU (Advance \nMicrowave Sounder Unit) onboard Aqua and NOAA 17, and MADRAS and SAPHIR \nonboard MT. The frequencies above 90 GHz are commonly used for studying the cloud \nproperties (e.g., Liu and Curry, 1990, Weng, 2003, etc.). Hong et al. (2005) have \nstudied the sensitivity of the microwave brightness temperatures to hydrometeors at 89-\n190 GHz frequencies, and found that frequencies near water vapor absorption band at \n183.31 GHz (e.g., AMSU-B channels) are nearly independent of surface emissivity \nbecause of atmospheric opacity at these frequencies. This finding allows development \nof retrieval algorithms for rain/cloud and other atmospheric parameters independent of \nthe underlying surface type. Several other researchers (e.g., Muller et al., 1994; Hong et \nal., 2005) have also studied the effect of cloud ice and precipitation on AMSU-B water \nvapor channels. A depression in the satellite measured brightness temperature at \nfrequencies near water vapor absorption line (183.31 GHz) is resulted from the \nhydrometeors on the top of the cloud, and the depression increases for frequencies \naway from the water vapor absorption line (Burns et al., 1997). Thus for SAPHIR, we \nexpect higher depression for 183.3111 GHz channel. Bennartz and Bauer (2003) have \nstudied the sensitivity of the frequencies near 183.31 GHz water vapor absorption line \nto ice particle scattering in different environmental conditions, and reported little \nsensitivity to precipitating clouds below 8 km of altitude, which they attributed to the \npeaking of the weighting functions at higher altitudes.  The study by Bennartz and Bauer \n(2003) was conducted for middle and higher latitude conditions and for 1837, 1833, \n1831 GHz channels, we, however, expect a higher sensitivity of SAPHIR 18311 GHz \nchannel to precipitating clouds.  \n \nSAPHIR on MT collects microwave radiances from the environment at 6 channels \naround water vapor absorption band at 183.3 GHz. These channels are referred as S1, \nS2, S3, S4, S5 and S6 with central operating frequency of 183.31±0.2 GHz, 183.31±1.1 \nGHz, 183.31±2.8 GHz, 183.31±4.2 GHz, 183.31±6.8 GHz, and 183.31±11.0 GHz. The \nSAPHIR sweeps a swath of ~1700 km while carrying out cross-track scanning of 50o \non both sides of the nadir. The SAPHIR swath dataset comprises of 182 pixels with 91 \npixels on both sides of the nadir. It provides variable local incidence angle along the \nswath at the surface of the Earth. The spatial resolution also varies along the swath \nfrom 10 km at nadir to about 22 km at pixel locations 1 and 182.  In the present study \n \n4\nwe have used SAPHIR swath observations of period from March - May 2013 and also of \nPhaillin Cyclone over the Bay of Bengal on 11 October 2013. \n \nIn this report, we make an attempt to detect and determine precipitation amount using \nSAPHIR frequencies near water vapor absorption line at 183.31 GHz (Table-2).  The \nrain measured from SAPHIR may provide an alternate and independent set of \nmeasurements to fulfill the MT Science objectives, especially in view of absence of \nMADRAS measurements.  \n \n2.  Rain Detection \n \nRain identification algorithm is an integral part of any satellite passive microwave based \nrain retrieval algorithm. At microwave frequencies (say, from 6 GHz to 190 GHz) \nvariations in the surface emissivity, surface and atmospheric temperature, water vapor, \ncloud liquid water or wind speed may produce the brightness temperature (Tb) \nvariations of the same order as that due to rain rates. Apart from that the uncertainties \nobserved in the brightness temperature versus rain rate relationship due to horizontal \nand vertical rain variability within satellite IFOV makes it extremely difficult to \ndifferentiate low rain rates from the background field (Varma et al., 2004). The rain \nidentification over the land is even more complex due to strong and highly varying \nemissivity, especially at low microwave frequencies. Varma and Pal (2012) have \nprovided a detailed account of the problem of precipitation detection by passive \nmicrowave measurements.  \n \nHere, we intend to develop a rain identification algorithm using SAPHIR brightness \ntemperature measurements. Because of high atmospheric opacity at frequencies near \nthe water vapor absorption line (183.31 GHz), the measurements are nearly \nindependent of the surface emissivity (Hong et al., 2005), but the cloud structure over \nland is different than the oceans (Kawamoto and Suzuki, 2013, Varma and Liu, 2006);   \nClouds over land usually develop much deeper than that over the oceans, and \ntherefore, they may exhibit different brightness temperature depression for a given rain \nrate. Furthermore, unlike passive microwave radiometers with conical scan mechanism \nthat are traditionally used for rain measurement, like SSM/I, TMI, MADRAS, etc., the \nSAPHIR incidence angle at each scan position differs and that has to be incorporated in \nany retrieval algorithm. Ideally, the pixels that are equidistant from the nadir on a scan \nline should have same incidence angle. But such pixels may still have asymmetry \nresulting from radio frequency interference problem of the instrument (Buehler et al., \n2005). Thus we have attempted the development of the algorithm by considering all 182 \npixels independently over land and oceans.  \n \nIn order to develop rain identification algorithm, we use concurrent observations from \nSAPHIR and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)- Precipitation Radar PR. \nApart from PR, TRMM also carried onboard a microwave radiometer which is referred \nas Microwave Radiometer (TMI). Rain rates are provided by both TMI and PR. TMI \noperates at 10.65, 19.35, 21.3, 37.0, and 85.5 GHz with all frequencies, except 21.3 \nGHz (only V) received radiation in both vertical and horizontal polarizations.  TRMM is a \n \n5\nlow orbiting satellite, which provides coverage between about 36o S and 36o N latitudes. \nThe PR scans ± 17° from the nadir with 49 positions result in a 215 km swath, with a \nspatial resolution of 4.3 km. In August 2001 the TRMM orbit was raised from 350 to 403 \nkm, and that resulted to extended swath of 247 km and spatial resolution of ~5 km. In \nthe present study, we use precipitation radar measurements taken from TRMM \nstandard swath product 2A25, which contains the rainfall rates from surface to 20 km \naltitude with 250 m vertical resolution. We have also taken surface rain rates from TMI \nstandard data product 2A12. The TRMM sensor package has been described by \nKummerow et al. (1998), and PR rain measurement algorithm is provided by Awaka et \nal. (1997). The TRMM sensor package has been described by Kummerow et al. (1998), \nand PR rain measurement algorithm is provided by Awaka et al. (1997).  \n \nThe dataset of PR-SAPHIR concurrent observations is prepared by collocating SAPHIR \nand PR observations over space and time. We assume a circular foot print of SAPHIR \nof diameter 10 km at the nadir and that varies linearly to 22 km at the beginning and end \nof a scan line (i.e., pixel # 1 and 182). We find all the PR observations that fall on a \nSAPHIR footprint within 10 minutes of time difference and calculate the weighted \naverage surface rain rate from PR observations. The weight is varied commensurating \nfor an assumed isotropic antenna gain pattern over the footprint. This way we generate \na collocated SAPHIR-PR dataset for March 2013 for further analysis. We refer it as \ntraining dataset in the succeeding part of this report. Given the temporal variability of the \nprecipitation (Piyush et al., 2012) and non-circular footprint of the SAPHIR away from \nnadir, collocation of two datasets in spatial and temporal domain is not the perfact, yet \nkeeps the procedure of collocation simple while providing a large collocated dataset of \nabout 1.7 million observations over the ocean and 0.7 million over land. The rain \nidentification and retrieval scheme have been performed separately for the land and \noceans. We further divided dataset into rainy and non-rainy sets for 182 swath positions \nof the SAPHIR. We examine the probability distribution (PDF) of brightness \ntemperatures measured at all 6 channels of SAPHIR for rainy and non-rainy conditions \nfor all scan locations. Figure 1 (a) to (f) show plots of PDFs of SAPHIR brightness \ntemperatures for channel S1 and S6 for a typical scan position # 45 for rainy and non-\nrainy conditions over the oceans. There do exist similar PDFs for other pixel locations \nover the oceans and land. The PDF of the brightness temperatures for rainy cases is \nshown as line joining open circles and that for non-rainy cases is shown as line joining \nsolid circles. It may be observed that there is large overlap of PDFs of brightness \ntemperatures from all the channels for rainy and non-rainy cases, and thus making it \ndifficult to identify a threshold value of brightness temperature for clearly demarcating \nrainy and non-rainy conditions.  Despite of having large overlap area between PDFs of \nrainy and non-rainy cases, the Fig. 1 shows clear and distinct peaks of PDFs for two \ncases in all the 6 channels of SAPHIR, which suggest some tangible sensitivity of the \nbrightness temperatures to rain.  Figure 1 shows PDFs of brightness temperatures for a \ntypical scan position over the oceans, there, however, exists similar qualitative behavior \nof PDFs of brightness temperatures for rainy and non-rainy cases at other scan \npositions over land and oceans as well. We thus take advantage of sensitivity of all the \nsix SAPHIR channels towards rainfall as provided by the probability distribution of \nbrightness temperatures for rainy and non-rain cases, separately for all 182 pixel \n \n6\nlocations (please note that Fig. 1 (a) – (f) is just an example for pixel location # 45 over \nthe oceans), and calculate the average probability of a given pixel as rainy (PR) and \nnon-rainy (PNR). We normalize the PR and PNR to make their sum unity. Now, we \nexamine the PR (or PNR) by plotting distribution of PR from all pixel locations calculated \nseparately from rainy and non-rainy SAPHIR-PR collocated training datasets (Fig. 2a) \nfor ocean and Fig (2b) for the land. The distribution of PR from non-rainy dataset is \nshown as line joining open circles and that for rainy dataset is shown as line joining \nopen triangles. We still find a large overlap between two plots in Fig.2 (a), (b). However, \nwe notice a long tail in the distribution of PR associated with non-rainy dataset and a \ndouble peak in the distribution associated with rainy dataset. Thus it is possible that in \nthe SAPHIR-PR collocated dataset a large number of pixels which are considered as \nnon-raining are actually rainy and vice versa. This could be possible as collocation in \nspace and time is not perfect as discussed above. There may also be some problem in \nthe collocation due to other reasons like sensitivity of PR (~0.7 mm/h) (anonymous, \n2011), angle of observation, etc. Thus, we do not take PR=0.5 as the threshold value to \nidentify rain/no-rain and a more appropriate value of the PR threshold is worked out. We \nexamined different threshold values of PR and tried to identify most appropriate value of \nPR which is optimized for minimal error in the identification of rain/no-rain. This \nprocedure led us to find a PR value of 0.6 as most appropriate value for ocean and 0.63 \nfor land. According to Fig. 2 (a), the PR threshold of 0.6 results in about 9% false rain \npixels from non-rainy pixels and 34% missing rain from rainy pixels over oceans, \nwhereas, over land with PR = 0.63 there is about 7% false rain pixels from non-rainy and \n27% missing rain from rainy pixels. We further examine how these wrongly identified \npixels with PR thresholds would have likely ramification on the rain identification and \nmeasurement. Figure 3 (a) and (b) shows the average rain with vertical bars of \nStandard Deviation (SD) as a function of PR from the rainy dataset of ocean and land, \nrespectively. As expected the average rain is small in lower values of PR, and increases \nas we go to higher values of PR. Over oceans, the average rain at PR = 0.6 is 0.13 mm/h \nwith SD of 0.54 mm/h. We follow the same procedure over land and find that average \nrain at PR = 0.63 is 0.09 mm/h with SD of 0.70 mm/h.  Thus, the rainy points that are \nclassified as non-rainy would contribute only to very low rain regime (say, < ~0.7 mm/h). \nWe further examine the non-raining point that turn raining with the PR thresholds. Figure \n4 shows the cumulative probability distribution of rain rates for such pixels. The rain rate \nis calculated from an algorithm discussed in the next section. From the Fig. 4, we find \nthat for oceans (open triangles) about 80% of the non-raining pixels that give false rain \nproduce an average rain of less than 0.15 mm/h. About 95% of such pixels produce \naverage rain of less than 0.35 mm/h, whereas for land about 52 % of the non-raining \npixels give an average rain of 0.15 mm/h, and 95 % of such pixels produce an average \nrain less than 0.65 mm/h and none of them yield average rain of more than 0.95 mm/h. \nThus, with the PR based rain/no-rain threshold, the rainy pixels that are classified as \nproducing missing-rain and the non-rainy pixels that are classified as producing false-\nrain has effect only in the low rain regime (i.e., < 1 mm/h). Given the errors in the rain \nestimation by the microwave radiometers (Varma et al., 2010, Varma and Pal, 2012), \nand the error involved in the spatial-temporal collocation of the SAPHIR-PR dataset, this \nerror in the rain identification can be considered as insignificant. Hence, with a PR \nthreshold of 0.6 and 0.63 as discussed above, we generate rain/no-rain map from \n \n7\nSAPHIR and also from TRMM 3B42 standard dataset. Figure 5 shows rain/no-rain map \nfor a typical day of 11 May 2013. Due to rain identification problem in very low rain \nregime, we have deliberately avoided low rain rates of < 0.25 mm/h. Again the SAPHIR \nrain is determined using the rain retrieval algorithm discussed in the next section. The \nFig. 5 shows that rain area by SAPHIR matches fairly well with that from 3B42. \n \n3.  Rain Retrieval \n \nIn the previous section, rain identification in SAPHIR observations is discussed. In this \nsection, we make an attempt to retrieve the rain. For development of the retrieval \nalgorithm, we first tried to examine the expected behavior of SAPHIR frequency \nchannels with rain. For that we use radiative transfer simulations, we simulate \nbrightness temperatures using a scattering based microwave radiative transfer model \n(MWRT) developed by Liu (1998) for all the six channels of SAPHIR. In these model \nsimulations, we use a standard tropical atmospheric profile over calm oceans with \nsurface temperature of 300 K. Figure 6 (a) shows plot of the brightness temperature \nversus rain rate for a typical scan position of for all the six channels of SAPHIR. Here, it \nmay be observed that channel 1 (S1) i.e., at 183.31±0.2 GHz, exhibits the minimum \nslope and is thus least affected, and channel 6 (S6) i.e., at 183.31±11.0 GHz, exhibits \nthe maximum slope and is thus most affected by the rain This is in agreement with \nmany previous studies (e.g. Eymard et al., 2001, Bennartz and Bauer, 2003, etc.). Next, \nwe have taken the difference of these two channels and tried to analyze the behavior \nagainst the rain rate. Taking this into consideration, we try to observe the relation of \nbrightness temperature difference of least and most affected channels with rain rate. Fig \n6 (b) shows the variation of brightness temperature difference (Tb) with rain rate \n(mm/h), which is exponential in nature. We follow the same procedure on land also, and \nthe exponential relation holds well over land too, with different pairs of coefficients. A \nsimilar relationship is observed for all other scan locations over land and oceans. \n \nFor rain retrieval algorithm, we use the SAPHIR and PR collocated dataset as referred \nin the previous section. First, for each of the scan positions, we separate the data over \nland and ocean and then divided them further into two parts - rainy and no rainy. We, \nhowever, use only rainy pixels and referred this dataset as a training data set. As \ndiscussed above, from radiative transfer simulations, we find an exponential relationship \nbetween rain rate and the difference of brightness temperatures measured at S1 and \nS2. We thus use the following form of the equation for ocean and land and for each \npixel location, \n \nb\nT\n*\nc\ne\n*\nb\na\nR\n\n\n\n                                    (1) \n \nWhere, R is rain rate in (mm/h), a, b and c are regression coefficients. We calculate the \nvalues of a, b and c for separately over land and oceans and at each of the pixel \nlocations. In order to define the accuracy of the rain estimation algorithm, we apply rain \nidentification algorithm and the eq. (1) to the training dataset of collocated SAPHIR and \nPR observations of rainy pixels and calculate rain rate from SAPHIR observations at \neach pixel location and compared with the PR rain rates. This provides a correlation of \n \n8\n0.70, rms error of 0.81 mm/h and bias of 0.04 mm/h for total number of observations of \nabout 0.94 million. When we consider all the collocated SAPHIR and PR observations \nfrom the training dataset comprising of rain as well as no rain observations, the \ncorrelation still remains 0.68 with an rms error of 0.45 mm/h, and bias of 0.01 mm/h for \ntotal number of 2.06 million observations. If this algorithm is used operationally, the \nSAPHIR observations subjected to the rain retrieval algorithm would not be pre-\nclassified as rainy or non-rainy and hence the statistics provided in the latter case \nprovides the algorithm accuracy.  In order to test the algorithm with independent \ndataset, we have collocated SAPHIR and PR measurement for another one month of \nApril 2013 by following the same procedure for collocation as done for training dataset. \nWe refer this dataset as test dataset and apply the algorithm to the test dataset and \ncompare the rain from SAPHIR with that from PR. With a test dataset we find a \ncorrelation of 0.58, rms error of 0.91 mm/h and bias of 0.07 mm/h for total number of \nobservations of 2.3 million. These results are very encouraging given the high temporal \nvariability of precipitation (Piyush et al., 2012) and possible imperfection in preparing \ncollocated dataset of SAPHIR and PR as discussed earlier. These results appear to be \nmore encouraging in view of similar comparison that we carried out between TMI and \nPR for a period of 10 days from 21-30 May 2009 that shows a correlation of 0.61, rms \nerror of 2.23 mm/h, and bias of 0.1 mm/h for total number of observations of 1.88 \nmillion.  It may be noted that PR and TMI are on the same orbiting platform with less \nthan a minute of time difference between their observations, whereas we allowed 10 \nminutes of time difference between SAPHIR and PR observations.  \n \nFurther, we have compared the monthly averaged rain rates from SAPHIR, TRMM-\n3B42 and SSMIS. Figure 7 (a), (b) and (c) shows the monthly gridded (0.25oX0.25o) \nmaps of precipitation for the month of May 2013 from SAPHIR, TRMM-3B42 and \nSSMIS. Here we use SSMIS rain product (Hilburn and Wentz, 2008) which provides \nrain only over the oceans. As it can be seen there is a good qualitative comparison \namong three different rain products. The scatter plots of cross comparison among these \nthree monthly maps is plotted in Fig. 8, which shows comparison between SAPHIR \nversus TRMM-3B42, SAPHIR versus SSMIS and SSMIS versus TRMM-3B42, \nrespectively. The Fig. 8 (a) (b) and (c)  shows the comparison over the land as well as \nthe oceans, whereas other two Figs. 7 (d) and (e) shows a comparison over oceans \nonly.  The comparison between SAPHIR and TRMM-3B42 is most encouraging with a \ncorrelation coefficient of ~0.87 over ocean and 0.82 over land, when ocean and land \nboth considered together correlation becomes 0.84 with rmse of 0.09 mm for 327743 \nvalid points. On the other hand, the comparison of SSMIS monthly rain with monthly \nrain from SAPHIR and TRMM-3B42 shows a correlation of 0.69 and 0.65, respectively.  \nSimilar comparison of daily averaged rain from SAPHIR, TRMM-3B42 and SSMIS \nshows correlation of 0.65, 0.48 and 0.54, and rms difference of 0.31, 0.62, 0.56 mm/h, \nrespectively. We have also tried to examine the distribution of daily averaged rain rates, \nfor that we compared the Probability Distribution Function (PDF) of daily averaged rain \nover tropics from SAPHIR with TRMM-3B42 for a typical month of May, 2013 (Fig. 9). \nThe Fig. 9 shows a good agreement of the PDF of the daily averaged rain from SAPHIR \nand 3B42. \n \n \n9\nIn order to show a meaningful comparison of the quality of rain estimation using \nSAPHIR with that from TMI and PR, we make monthly average comparison of rain over \nland from SAPHIR with TMI and PR in 2.5ox2.5o, and comparison with the similar \nstatistics between PR and TMI provided by Wang et al. (2009).  They have provided \ncomparison statistics of rain derived from TMI (2A12), PR (2A25) and Global \nPrecipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) (Rudolf, 1995). Based on 10 years of TRMM \nobservations over land they have reported a correlation of 0.78 between 2A12 and \n2A25 monthly mean rain rates. We have also compared SAPHIR monthly rain rates with \nTMI and PR for a typical month of November 2012 and found a correlation of 0.86 \nbetween SAPHIR and 2A12, and 0.68 between SAPHIR and 2A25 observations. For \nthe same month, we find a correlation of 0.71 between 2A12 and 2A25. While \ncomparing the statistics, it has to be borne in mind that TMI and PR have near \nconcurrent observations (within 1 min), whereas SAPHIR may have large time \ndifferences with TMI and PR observations. Nevertheless, the SAPHIR performs very \nwell vis-à-vis TMI and PR. \n \nWe have further presented rain from SAPHIR associated with a tropical cyclone Phailin \nthat persisted over the Bay of Bengal from 9-12 October, 2013. This was recorded as a \ncategory 5 cyclone with a maximum wind speed of about 140 knots. Phailin made its \nlandfall on 12 October 2013. A cyclonic system is an excellent atmospheric phenomena \nto critically evaluate the performance of the retrieval algorithm as several types of \nclouds and rain structures are present in the system. For comparison purpose, we have \nanalysed all the available rain products over that region which are coincident with the \nSAPHIR. We use 3B42 available as 3-hourly averaged rain rate, 3B40-RT and GSMaP \navailable as hourly averaged rain rates for this comparison. 3B42 (Huffman et al., 2007) \nis a merged product, 3B40-RT is an intermediate product of 3B42 which is derived from \nmicrowave observations only, whereas GSMaP (Aonashi et al., 2009) is a 0.10X0.10 \ngrided rain product which is available hourly. All the comparison performed here, are in \n0.250X0.250 rectangular grid. We calculate the rain from SAPHIR and presented in Fig \n10 (a). The corresponding rain from 3B42, GSMaP and 3B42-RT are shown in Fig 10 \n(b), (c) and (d), respectively. Over the study area, the Megha-Tropiques has an \nobservation time of ~2050 UTC, whereas all the other products are at 2100 UTC. From \nthese figures we can see SAPHIR picks up the intensity and pattern of rain over the \ncyclonic area very well, as exhibited by other rain products. When rain rates are \ncompared qualitatively between SAPHIR and 3B42, and between SAPHIR and GSMaP, \nwe find correlation of 0.64 and 0.70, rmse of 1.16 and 2.24 mm/h and bias of 0.12 and \n0.60 mm/h, respectively.  A similar comparison of rain from GSMaP and 3B42 shows a \ncorrelation of 0.72, rmse of, 2.1 mm/h and bias 0.26 mm/h. Here, it may be to note that \nthe discrepancies between different products are possibly due to their different \nobservation time. Nevertheless, SAPHIR rain shows a good agreement with TRMM \nproducts. \n \nThe study presented herein provides a detail account of rain detection and \nmeasurement algorithm from SAPHIR. The algorithm is in two parts; the first part deals \nwith rain identification, and the second provides the rain amount at identified pixels. The \nboth procedures are developed separately for land and oceans and for each of the 182 \n \n10 \nscan positions of the SAPHIR. We have carried out extensive study to examine the \nworthiness of the algorithm. This is carried out first by developing a probabilistic rain \nidentification algorithm for SAPHIR channels. We examined the effect of pixels with \nfalse rain and missing rain on rain identification. We find that their effect is limited to \nonly very low rain regime. We further compared the rain identified by SAPHIR with \nTRMM-3B42 and that shows a good match at rain rates > 0.25 mm/h. It may be recalled \nthat TRMM-3B42 is an IR-Microwave merged product and hence suppose to offer better \nestimate of rainfall than either of them. In the second step, we have tried to estimate \nrain rate at the rainy pixels. The rain measurement algorithm alone explains a \ncorrelation of 0.70, rms error of 0.81 mm/h and bias of 0.04 mm/h. Together with the \nrain identification procedure; it explains correlation of 0.68 with rms error of 0.45 mm/h, \nand bias of 0.01 mm/h. The algorithm is applied to independent SAPHIR dataset and \ncomparison results are presented. Further, monthly rain is compared with TRMM-3B42 \nrain, which explains a correlation of 0.84 and standard deviation 0.09 mm/h.  \nFurthermore, we have compared the instantaneous rain associated with Phailin cyclone \nfrom SAPHIR with other standard satellite based rain products like, GSMaP, 3B42, \n3B40-RT and found SAPHIR is very well able to capture the intensity and features of \nintense rain also. The comparison statistics presented in this report show that the \nSAPHIR rain retrieval algorithm works very well for rain identification as well as for rain \nestimation at instantaneous, daily and monthly basis. The comparison at instantaneous \nbasis with independent dataset (test dataset) gives us confidence that algorithm works \nsatisfactorily.    \n \n4. Operational Implementation Steps \n \n(a) We have static binary files for rain/no-rain probability over land and oceans. For \ngiven geolocation (land/ocean) and pixel-scan position, the probabilities of \nrain/no-rain for brightness temperature from each of the six channels are \ninstantaneously available.  These procedures are incorporated in the Fortran \nprogram. The probability values in the binary files are having 182*400*6 (are \narranged in following manner: \n \n \nRecord =1 – probability for pixel # 1, channel S1, Tb= 1 K \n     \nRecord =2 – probability for pixel # 1, channel S1, Tb= 2 K \n \n. \n \n. \n     \nRecord =400 – probability for pixel # 1, channel S1, Tb= 400 K \n \nRecord =401 – probability for pixel # 1, channel S2, Tb= 1 K \n \n. \n \n. \n \nRecord =400*6 – probability for pixel # 1, channel S6, Tb= 400 K \n \nRecord =400*6+1 – probability for pixel # 2, channel S1, Tb= 1 K \n \n. \n \n. \n \nRecord =182*400*6(436800) – probability for pixel # 182, channel S6, Tb= 400 K \n \n \n11 \n \nThe above arrangement of records, enable us to find the probability value \n \ninstantaneously for given pixel position, brightness temperature and frequency \n \nchannel from the input data file. This can be calculated as follows: \n \n \n                irec=(k-1)*2400+(j-1)*400+i \n \n \nwhere, irec is record number for finding the probability, k is scan position number, \n \nj is channel number and I is brightness temperature in integer. The probability \n \nvalues are available at each discreet integer values of the brightness \n \ntemperatures. For fractional part of the brightness temperatures, the probability is \n \ncalculated by linear interpolation from two adjacent integer values are performed. \n \n(b) Once the step 1 is completed, based on probability associated with all 6 \nchannels we find average probability of rain as PRR and probability of no-rain as \nPNR.  We then normalize them to get probability of rain (PR) and probability of no-\nrain (PN) as follows: \n \nNR\nRR\nNR\nN\nNR\nRR\nRR\nR\nP\nR\nP\nP\nP\nR\nP\nP\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA pixel is considered as rainy if PR> 0.63 over land and > 0.6 over oceans.  \n \n(c) Once a pixel is identified as rainy, we calculate rain from Equ. (1). The \ncoefficients a, b and c are different for each pixel locations and surface type \n(land/ocean). The coasts are considered having maritime atmosphere. We have \ngenerated a static dataset of coefficients in which each row has a set of \ncoefficients which represents the pixel location. For land a is found to be zero. \n \nA flow-chart of these procedures a provided in Fig. 11. \n \n5. Format of the output and the domain \nThe output is made available in the form of geolocation (latitude-longitude) and rain rate \nin mm h-1. The domain is global tropics within SAPHIR coverage area over land and \noceans. \n \n6. Expected Accuracy \n \nThe achieved accuracy of instantaneous rain retrieval with respect to TRMM-PR is 0.91 \nmm/h. \n \nOn monthly scale, expected rmse with respect to TRMM 3B42 V7 is ~0.1 mm/h. \n \n \n12 \n7. Conclusion and Future Scope \nThough SAPHIR is not specifically designed for rain estimation, yet it is shown for its \nuse for rain identification as well as for rain estimation. The best instrument on MT for \nrain estimation is MADRAS but it has already been declared as non-operational due to \nproblem with its scanning mechanism. In the absence of MADRAS observations, \nSAPHIR measurements can serve as supplementary to MADRAS measurements for \nrain measurement to fulfill the science objectives of the MT mission. The SAPHIR based \nrain identification may even help flagging off the humidity profile measurements by it. \nThe rain measurement from SAPHIR opens up opportunity for measuring rain from \nsimilar channels available on other satellite missions. In future, there is also possibility \nto combine SAPHIR measurements with thermal IR measurements from another \ninstrument, ScaRaB, on Megha-Tropiques for more accurate rain measurement.    \n \n8.

The MT satellite frequently \nmeasures radiation emitted by the Earth-Atmosphere System in the visible, \ninfrared and microwave spectrum through its four sensors onboard namely, \nMADRAS (Microwave Analysis and Detection of Rain and Atmospheric \nStructures), SAPHIR (Sondeur Atmosphérique du Profil d'Humidité Intertropical \npar Radiométrie), ScaRaB (Scanner for Radiation Budget) and ROSA (Radio \nOccultation Sensor for Atmosphere). The MADRAS system is a five-channel \n(18.7 GHz, 23.8 GHz, 36.5 GHz, 89 GHz and 157 GHz), dual polarized (except \n23.8 GHz), self-calibrating, microwave radiometer system with azimuth scanning \nof 65 yielding data swath of 1700 kms at local incidence angle of 53.5 at the \nEarth’s surface. The SAPHIR sensor is a microwave humidity sounder operating \naround 183.31 GHz with six-channels (±0.2, ±1.1, ±2.8, ±4.2, ±6.8 and ±11 GHz) \nwith cross-track scanning of 43 yielding data swath of 1705 Km with variable \nlocal incidence angle at the Earth’s surface. The ScaRaB sensor operates in four \nbands (0.55-0.65 m, 0.2-4.0 m, 0.2-50.0 m and 10.5-12.5 m) with a swath of \n2242 km with cross-track scanning of  48.9. ROSA tracks the dual-frequency L-\nband signals, transmitted by the GPS-GNSS, in both the fore and aft direction \nfrom limb sounding geometry giving 1-dimensional (vertical) profile of \ngeophysical parameters at various geo-locations of the earth. \n \n \nThe major task is the retrieval of various geophysical parameters from MT sensors \ninvolving complexities of the inverse problem and the characteristics of the \ninstruments. This draft document describes the theoretical basis of the algorithms \nfor retrieving various geophysical parameters from these sensors. These \nalgorithms are planned for the implementation on the operational basis for \ngeophysical data product generation from MT satellite data. Algorithms for each \nsensor are provided in separate sections as presented in this document. \n \nSection 2 describes the details of rainfall retrieval from MADRAS which includes \nthe state of the art of algorithms for retrieving rainfall rate using microwave \nradiometers, scattering based radiative transfer model, necessity of environmental \nand hydrometeor data sets, inversion techniques, prevailing retrieval accuracies \nand validation techniques. \n \nSection 3 deals with the retrieval of geophysical parameters namely, atmospheric \ntotal water vapour content, cloud liquid water content and ocean surface wind \nspeed from MADRAS. It describes the global scenario including Indian heritage, \nemission based radiative transfer model, simulation of environmental data, \nsimulation based retrieval techniques, fine-tuning and validation techniques. \n \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n5\nSection 4 is devoted to the retrieval of atmospheric humidity profile from \nSAPHIR sensor. It deals with the emission based radiative transfer model suitable \nfor sounding purpose, simulation of synthetic atmospheric profiles, sensitivity \nstudies, simulation results, inversion techniques and preliminary analysis of \nlimited AMSU-B sounder data. \n \nSection 5 describes the complexities of processes needed for estimation of top-of-\natmosphere radiation flux from the radiance measurements over the different \nportions of the electromagnetic spectrum by ScaRaB.  \n \nSection 6 deals with the retrieval of atmospheric profiles of temperature and \nhumidity using the information about the refractivity as an input made available \nfrom ROSA measurements. \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n6\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.0 Retrieval of Rainfall from MADRAS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n7\n2. \nRetrieval of Rainfall from MADRAS \n \n2.1 \nAlgorithm configuration information \n2.1.1 Algorithm name:  \nRainfall Retrieval (RAINRET) \n2.1.2 Algorithm Identifier:  \nISRO_MT_RAINRET_A001 \n2.1.3 Algorithm Specification \n \nVersion Prepared by \nDescription \n2.0 \nR.M. Gairola and \nA.K. Varma \nATBD for Rainfall Retrieval from MADRAS \n2.2 Introduction \n  \nRainfall is a highly discontinuous process both in space and time. Accurate \nand reliable measurements of rainfall over extensive areas of oceans present a \nformidable challenge to meteorologists. In addition to large uncertainties in the \nderived estimates, there are problems related to nonuniformities of coverage, \nquality and logistics of operations etc. The global observations and monitoring of \nclouds from space using remote sensing techniques, has the potential of providing \nglobal rainfall information on desired time and space scales (Kummerow et al. \n1995, Adler et al. 1994). Precipitation is associated with various atmospheric \nphenomena both in small and large scale. Assessment of precipitation contributes \nto improve weather forecasting, in small and large spatial scales, and a study of \nglobal rainfall leads to better understanding of global climate variability. \nIn addition, one of the strongest links between ocean, land and atmosphere \nis the fresh water fluxes due to evaporation and precipitation process. Evaporation \n(\"E\") controls the loss of fresh water and precipitation (\"P\") governs most of the \ngain of fresh water. Inputs from rivers and melting ice can also contribute to fresh \nwater gains. Evaporation minus precipitation is usually referred to as the net flux \nof fresh water or the total fresh water in or out of the oceans and can be \ndetermined from satellite remotes sensing methods (Gairola et al. 2007). E-P \ndetermines surface salinity of the ocean, which helps determine the stability of the \nwater column. Salinity and temperature determine the density of ocean water, and \ndensity influences the circulation. Precipitation also affects the height of the ocean \nsurface indirectly via salinity and density. The global increase in oceanic \nevaporation (E) is determined by the increase in surface heating and this controls \nthe global increase in precipitation (P). With the global warming scenario, it has \nbeen argued that increased moisture content of the atmosphere favours stronger \nrainfall events, thus increasing risk of flooding over land and more fresh water \nfluxes (E-P) over the oceans. It changes the buoyancy of the sea waters and also \nacts as a forcing function in OGCM.   \n \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n8\nThe development of rainfall estimation techniques based on remote \nsensing measurements from space has registered tremendous progress and realistic \nachievements over the last three decades. Like any other fields of endeavor, \nhowever, there are limitations too and newer and better measurement and \nestimation techniques are developed on a continuous basis. The ability of space \nbased  measurements to provide a 2-D distribution of rainfall over large areas with \nsufficiently frequent sampling in time, especially over data sparse oceanic regions, \nfacilitates us with a tremendously powerful tool to detect, closely monitor \nmonsoon system and study the genesis and evolution of the furious tropical \ncyclonic storm. \nMost tropical rainfall that has an impact over more than world's two-third \npopulation occurs as a result of convective processes.  Understanding rainfall and \nits variability will contribute significantly to making reliable monsoon forecast. In \naddition, the knowledge of precipitation as one of the initial state of the \natmosphere is necessary in weather prediction for  physical  initialization of \nnumerical models. For years the need for diabetic initialization of precipitation in \nnumerical models is being fulfilled by the infrared measurements by polar and \ngeostationary satellites, since IR/VI measurements are continuously available with \nlarger viewing areas and high resolution. \n  \nMicrowaves  can penetrate clouds and to some extent rain, and thus \nprovide another source for rainfall estimation over both land and oceans. Over the \nyears, passive microwave (PM) instruments on earth orbiting platforms have been \nproviding valuable information for precipitation estimation. The applications that \nbenefited from microwave rainfall estimates include weather forecasting, climate \nanalysis, and hydrological studies. The successful use of PM-based rain estimates \nin applications from various fields encourages the continuation of efforts toward \nthe development of more advanced rain retrieval algorithms, despite obvious \nlimitations associated with the low sampling frequency of orbiting platforms \ncarrying PM sensors. The recent availability of detailed precipitation observations \njointly obtained by the first space-borne precipitation radar (PR) and a \nmultifrequncy passive microwave radiometer, the TRMM Microwave Imager \n(TMI), on NASA-USA and NASDA-Japan’s Tropical Rainfall Measuring \nMission (TRMM) satellite offers an excellent opportunity for studying such \nissues. It  can also supplement the  observations from the IR/VIS measurements if \nproperly integrated/unified and brings out the finer details than any one alone. \n \n \n2.2.1 Overview and Background: Measurement of Rain by Space-Based \nMethods: \n \nVIS/IR Measurements of Rain : \nDigital image data from polar orbiting and geostationary meteorological \nsatellites with synoptic coverage and quasi-continuous sampling in time have now \nbecome the major tools for attempts to monitor rainfall from space. The most \ncommon and easily exploited image data - cloud images in the visible and thermal \nIR bands - provide reasonably direct information on cloud areal extent, cloud type \nand cloud growth and decay. However, cloud formation to rainfall is an involved \nprocess. The Visible/IR sensing from space does not permit direct measurement of \nraindrops and hence provides essentially indirect inferences from which useful \nestimates of rain falling below the cloud may be derived. \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n9\nEncouraged by the overpowering advantages of spacebased observations, \neven these proxy indicators have been exploited to severe as a basis for \ndevelopment of a variety of techniques for estimation of rainfall. The basic \nassumption that underlies all rainfall estimation techniques which utilize satellite \nimages in the Visible and IR band is that raining clouds can be distinguished from \nnon-raining ones : the former are usually thick and tall producing high visible \nband reflectance and cold cloud top temperatures. The possible physical basis for \nthis lies mainly in the fact that cold high clouds represent signatures of upward \nmotion in  a locally saturated atmosphere indicating deep convection. \nThe available schemes use visible and/or IR imagery and time evolution of \ncloud characteristics e.g. merging of cumulus clouds, cloud bands, anvils etc. seen \nin hourly/half hourly images. Many of these schemes are interactive in nature. \nOver the Indian region, monthly average rainfll information in the form of \nquantitative precipitation estimate (QPEs) maps with spatial resolution of \n2.50x2.50 are produced on a regular basis since 1986 using INSAT-VHRR IR \nimages collected eight times daily (Arkin et al. 1989). These maps are produced \nfollowing the Arkin and Miesner (1987) tecnique. Currently rainfall estimation \nfrom IR and Water Vapour channels of KALPANA and INSAT-3A are being \nutilized for the development of advanced algorithms for rainfall estimation over \nland and oceanic regions at 2.50x2.50 and sub-grid scale (0.250x0.250) by Gairola \net al. (2007) by both GPI and INSAT Multi Spectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA) \n(Gairola et al. 2007). \n  \nMicrowave Measurements of Rain: \nSatellite microwave radiometers have been successfully used to monitor \nthe temporal and spatial variations of sea surface and atmospheric properties on \nglobal scale since the launch of the Soviet Cosmos-243 instrument in 1969. The \nprocess of using satellite data for such applications is complex. Grody (1993) \nprovided a complete review of past, present and planned future satellite \nmicrowave \ninstruments, \nincluding \ntheir \noperational \ncharacteristics \nand \napplications. Among all the geophysical parameters, rainfall is the most difficult \nparameter to be retrieved from satellite remote sensing due to the intermittent \nnature of the processes of rain occurrence and its highly complex \nemission/absorption and scattering properties. \nMicrowave, due to their long wavelengths  achieve better penetration and \ninteract strongly with the raindrops present in the cloud. These measurements \nprovide a direct physical basis for rain estimation. Also microwaves are largely \nintensive to the presence of ice in thin cirrus clouds but only suffers its poor \nresolution capability. The precipitation monitoring capability of SSM/I has been \ndemonstrated by many investigators. Wilheit et al. (1991) used multichannel \nmicrowave measurements for the rainfall retrieval. Negri et al. (1989) discussed \nmeteorological interpretations with the false color images of 85 GHz (HH, VV) \nand 37 GHz (VV) for precipitation processes and clarification of land, ocean and \nsea ice types with SSM/I. Berg (1992) estimated and analyze inter-annual \nvariations in the tropical oceanic rainfall using data from SSM/I. ).  \nMicrowave radiances reaching satellite altitudes from precipitating clouds \ncontaining aspherical ice, combined phase hydrometeors and the background \natmosphere (cloud liquid water, water  vapor and gaseous constituents etc.) within \nthe instrument field of view. The upwelling radiation observed by a microwave \nradiometer is expressed as an equivalent brightness temperature Tb and the ability \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n10\nof passive microwave radiometer to infer rainfall depends largely on the contrast \nbetween the observed brightness temperatures over raining and non-raining areas. \nSome of the sensitivity studies have been carried out through radiative transfer \nsimulation by (Swaminathan et al. 2005, Deiveegan et al. 2007, Viltard et al. \n1998, Bauer et al. 1993, Gairola et al. 2001, 2005 etc) and through the empirical \napproach (Varma et al. 2003, Pokhrel et al. 2004 etc.) and  showed the possibility \nof rainfall over Ocean and land regions. \nUtilizing the frequency and polarization discrimination of passive \nmicrowave measurements from space, it has been successfully demonstrated that \nsatisfactory rainfall retrievals both over land and oceanic areas are feasible. It has \nbeen seen that satellite estimates based on passive measurements portray the \nrainfall as accurately as radar both in terms of relative intensity and spatial \ndistribution. \n \nRainfall over the oceans are retrieved relatively more reliably than over \nland. In total, the applications that benefited from microwave rainfall estimates \ninclude weather forecasting (Xiao et al. 2000), climate analysis (Hou et al. 2000), \nand hydrological studies (Petty and Krajwski 1996). The successful use of PM-\nbased rain estimates in applications from various fields encourages the \ncontinuation of efforts towards the development of more advanced rain retrieval \nalgorithms, despite obvious limitations associated with the low sampling \nfrequency of orbiting platforms carrying PM sensors. The recent availability of \ndetailed precipitation observations jointly obtained by the first space-borne \nprecipitation radar (PR) and a multifrequency passive microwave radiometer, \nTMI, on NASA and NASDA’s TRMM satellite (Simpsion et al. 1996) offers such \nan excellent opportunity for studying such issues. \nStill with such missions dedicated to rainfall estimation, rain retrieval \nalgorithms from PM radiometry suffer from various limitations. These limitations \noriginate in the multiple hydrometeor profiles that can be associated with a set of \nmultifrequency PM measurements (i.e., lack of unique solution The indeterminacy \nis more ever for overland retrievals because of the warm background brightness \ntemperatures that limit the use of lower-frequency observations (i.e., 10, 19, and \n22 GHz). Some algorithms, referred to as physically based, are derived using \nradiative transfer calculations through cloud-model simulated fields (Kummerow \net al. 1996, Haferman et al. 1997). The physically based algorithms were mainly \ninvestigated in over ocean retrievals. Such physically based retrieval over land are \nfew and have not indicated better performance relative to purely statistical \nalgorithms (Druen and Heinemann 1998), which are conceptually simpler and \nmore practical for applications. \nIn the beginning an algorithm for oceanic rainfall was developed   for \n19.35 GHz observations from Nimbus-5 Electrically Scanning Microwave \nRadiometer (ESMR) by Wilheit et al. (1977). Further modification to the \nalgorithm was made by using statistical technique for multichannel data in the \nNimbus-7 Scanning Multichannel  Microwave Radiometer  (SMMR) data \n(Wilheit and Chang 1980). Currently the 85 GHz channel in DMSP-SSM/I (F10, \nF11, F12, F13) and TRMM-TMI offers better possibilities of rainfall estimation. \nThe optimal combination of integrated MW and IR observations offers a unique \nopportunity for rainfall retrieval more accurately (Gairola and Krishnamurti 1992, \nGairola et al. 2005, Jobard and Desbois 1994, Adler et al. 1994, Liu et al. 1995). \nHowever it requires the rainfall from individual streams (either IR or MW based) \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n11\nrain algorithms well placed.  In addition to various SSM/I sensors  presently \navailable for the rainfall estimation, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission \n(TRMM) provides the best opportunity with all type of passive (MW and VIS/IR) \nand active (MW) sensors onboard as a prelude to the Megha-Tropiques. \n \n \n2.3. System Description \n \nMADRAS (Microwave Analysis and Detection of Rain and Atmospheric \nStructures)  \n \nThe proposed MADRAS system is a five-channel, self-calibrating, microwave \nradiometer system.  This radiometer is designed to estimate atmospheric water \nparameters in the tropical belt.  The choice of the channels has been driven by \ntheir potential contribution to the measurement of the parameters defined above, \nfrom the experience of processing other radiometer data.

Algorithm functional specifications \n2.5.1  Overview: \nMicrowave brightness temperatures measured from a satellite-borne radiometer \nresults from the integrated effects of surface emission and reflection, absorption \nand emission by atmospheric gases, and absorption, emission and multiple \nscattering of cloud and precipitation particles. Once scattering in the atmosphere \nbecomes important (at 85.5 GHz, in particular for cases two and four), the \ninfluence of the model treatment of multiple scattering overrides the surface \neffect. To accurately describe the microwave signatures, a radiative transfer model \nwith full inclusion of the aforementioned effects, particularly the multiple \nscattering by precipitation particles, is required.   \n  \nThe Theory of radiative transfer basically describes the interaction and \npropagation of radiative energy in a medium. As radiation is the most important \nsource of energy for driving all the atmospheric processes and also atmospheric \ndynamics is strongly influenced by how solar and the terrestrial radiations are \nscattered, absorbed and emitted by the earth’s surface and the atmosphere. Thus \nthe knowledge of radiative transfer is most fundamental in the retrieval of \natmospheric and earth’s surface parameters in space-borne remote sensing. The \nextensive coverage of radiative transfer formulations has been made by \nChandrasekhar (1960). \n \n2.5.2 Theoretical Background: \nIt is the fundamental integro-differential equation, which governs the variation of \nintensity in a medium characterized by a spectral volumetric absorption \ncoefficient, K(s), and a spectral volumetric scattering coefficient, (s), where s \nis the distance along the absorbing path.  \nLet us define the spectral volumetric extinction coefficient as \n)s(\nσ\n)s(\nK\n)s(\nβ\nν\nν\nν\n\n\n                                                                                                   \nFinally dividing 3 equation by \n)s(\nβν\nwe get \n)\nΩ\n,s(\nJ\n)\nΩ\n,s(\nI\nds\n)\nΩ\n,s(\ndI\n)s(\nβ\n1\nν\nν\nν\nν\n\n\n                                                                     (1) \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n13\nWhere \n'\n'\nΩ\nν\nν\nν\nν\nν\nν\nΩ\nd\n)\nΩ\n,s(\nI)\nθ\n(cos\nP\nπ\n4\nω\n)\nT\n(\nB\n)\nω\n1(\n)s(\nβ\nj\nJ\n'\n\n\n\n\n                                        (2) \nis referred to as the source function and  \n)s(\nβ\n)s(\nσ\nω\nν\nν\nν \n                                                                                                            (3) \nis called the single-scattering albedo, or particle albedo and expresses the fraction \nof the attenuated beam which is lost to scattering alone. \nEquation 5 is the general equation of transfer and it is fundamental in the \ndiscussion of any radiative transfer process. \n \nThe RTE for Plane-Parallel Atmosphere \n In plane-parallel atmospheres the medium is stratified in planes \nperpendicular to a given direction z, such that the optical properties of the medium \nare functions of z and  only. Since thickness of a planetary atmosphere is \ngenerally small compared with its radius, thus this assumption is universally \napplied. \nFrom figure we have  \ndz\n)\n(\nd\nμ\ndz\n)\n(\nd\nθ\ncos\nds\n)\n(\nd\n\n\n  \nThus equation 3 in terms of z, μ , and φ : \n  \n)\nφ\n,\nμ\n,z(\nJ\n)\nφ\n,\nμ\n,z\n(\nI\ndz\n)\nφ\n,\nμ\n,z\n(\ndI\n)z\n(\nβ\nμ\nν\nν\nν\nν\n\n\n                                                         (4) \nhere in J, \n \n'φ\nd'μ\nd\n'φ\nd'θ\nd'θ\nsin\n'\nΩ\nd\n\n\n\n                                                                                 (5) \nso that \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\nν\n0\nπ\n2\n0\nν\nν\nν\nν\n'φ\nd'μ\nd\n)'φ\n,'μ\n,z\n(\nI)\nθ\n(cos\nP\nπ\n4\nω\n)]\nz(\nT\n[\nB\n)\nω\n1(\n)\nφ\n,\nμ\n,z\n(\nJ\n                   (6) \nFor convenience, introducing the concept of optical depth, \nντ , measured from the \nouter boundary downward as \n \n\n\n\nz\nν\nν\n'\ndz\n)'z\n(\nβ\nτ\n                                \ndz\n)z\n(\nβ\nτ\nd\nν\nν\n\n\n                                                                                                    (7) \nThus replacing height variable z by optical depth \nντ in equation (2.18) we have \n \n)\nφ\n,\nμ\n,\nτ(\nJ\n)\nφ\n,\nμ\n,\nτ(\nI\nτ\nd\n)\nφ\n,\nμ\n,\nτ(\ndI\nμ\nν\nν\nν\nν\nν\nν\nν\n\n\n\nor \n \n)\nφ\n,\nμ\n,\nτ(\nJ\n)\nφ\n,\nμ\n,\nτ(\nI\nτ\nd\n)\nφ\n,\nμ\n,\nτ(\ndI\nμ\nν\nν\nν\nν\nν\nν\nν\n\n\n                                                           (8) \nwith \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\nν\nν\n0\nπ\n2\n0\nν\nν\nν\nν\nν\nν\n'φ\nd'μ\nd\n)'φ\n,'μ\n,\nτ(\nI)\nθ\n(cos\nP\nπ\n4\nω\n)]\nτ(\nT\n[\nB\n)\nω\n1(\n)\nφ\n,\nμ\n,\nτ(\nJ\n              (9)   \nEquation (8) is the basic equation for the problem of radiative transfer in the \nplane-parallel atmosphere, which is extremely difficult to solve. Part of difficulty \nis due to the azimuthal dependence of I through the phase function. By expanding \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n14\nthe phase function in a Legendre polynomial series, the azimuthally dependent \nterms in the function can be uncoupled. Only the azimuthally independent \nequation contributes to the flux calculations, which is of greatest interest in most \natmospheric applications. Thus confining our solution for the azimuthally \nindependent equation. \n \nRadiative transfer models: \n \nThe following two radiative transfer models are being used at SAC for simulations \nand sensitivity studies. \n \n1. Eddington approximations \n                  \nIn Eddington approximation it is assumed that for an isotropic field the ratio of the \nsecond moment of the radiation field to the mean intensity is everywhere equal to \n1/3.  \nIn the plane parallel Eddington approximation, radiances are expanded in a series \nof Legendre and associated Legendre functions: \n.....\nθ\ncos\n)z(\nI\n)z\n(\nI\n)\nφ\n,θ\n,\nτ(\nI\n1\n0\nν\nν\n\n\n\n                                                                   (10) \nand the phase function is similarly expanded in Legendre polynomials \n \n..........\nθ\ncos\nω\n1\n)\nθ\n(cos\nP\nω\n)\nθ\n(cos\nP\n0\n1\nN\n0\nl\n0\nl\nl\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n                                           (11) \nwhere \n0\nθ is the angle from ’, ’ to , , and the source function J(z, , ) can be \nwritten as \n]\nθ\ncos\n)z\n(\nI)z(\ng\n)z(\nI\n)[\nz\n(\nω\n)z(\nT\n)]\nz\n(\nω\n1[\n)\nφ\n,θ\n,z(\nJ\n1\n0\nν\n\n\n\n\n                                  (12) \nwhere the asymmetry factor is given by \n3\nω\ng\n1\n\n. Using this expression the \nisotropic component of the diffuse radiance I0 can be deduced following \n(Weinman and Davies, 1978) \n  \n2. Discrete Ordinate Approximations \nThe radiative transfer equation 15 in terms of polarization p (H or V) can \nbe expressed as (Tsang and Kong, 1977): \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\n)τ(\nB\n)\nω\n1(\n'μ\nd\n)\nμ\n,τ(\nI\n)\nμ\n,τ(\nI\nP\nP\nP\nP\n2\nω\n)\nμ\n,τ(\nI\n)\nμ\n,τ(\nI\n)\nμ\n,τ(\nI\n)\nμ\n,τ(\nI\nτ\nd\nd\nμ\n0\n1\n1\nH\nV\nHH\nHV\nVH\nVV\n0\nH\nV\nH\nV\n      \n(13) \nWhere all the symbols have their usual meaning.

In this DOM model it \nis assumed that cross-polarization scattering in the scattering source term is \nnegligible and the scattering phase function is assumed to follow Henyey-\nGreenstein equation, and is expended with Legendre polynomial (pl) as \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n0\n0\nN\n0\n0\n2\n3\n0\n2\n2\n0\n)\nθ\n(cos\np\nA\n)\nθ\n(cos\np\ng\n)1\n2\n(\n)\nθ\ncos\ng\n2\ng\n1(\ng\n1\n)\nθ\n(cos\nP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (14) \nFor azimuth-independent case (spheres, randomly-orientated irregular particles), \nthe cosine of the scattering angle \n0\nθ\ncos\ncan be denoted as ’ (Liou, 1974), so \nthat \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n0\nN\n0\n0\n)'μ\n(\np\n)\nμ\n(\np\nA\n)'μ\n(\np\n)\nμ\n(\np\ng\n)1\n2\n(\n)'μ\n,\nμ\n(\nP\n)\nθ\n(cos\nP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  (15) \nWhere asymmetry factor g is calculated following Mie theory (Bohren and \nHuffman, 1983), \n)\nμ\n(\np\nis the lth order Legendre polynomial and N is the number \nof terms to add.

To minimize the \nerror associated with this cutoff, a -adjustment (scaling g, , and 0) is applied  \nfollowing (Fu and Liou, 1992). \nIn performing numerical calculations, we divide the atmosphere into many \nlayers and assume that all microphysical properties (e.g., particle concentration, \nliquid/ice water content, etc.) are uniform within each layer, but temperature \nvaries linearly with optical depth. By solving the Ljs the radiances at quadrature \nangles (i) are obtained.    A boundary condition at the surface allows us to \ncalculate the upward radiation at surface given the surface emissivity and \ntemperature. Using this analogy of calculating downward radiation from top layer \nto surface, upward radiance can be can continuously calculated from the bottom of \nthe layer to the top of the layer  and letting  = 0 until the radiance at the top of the \nlayer is solved. The satellite observed radiance at the top of the atmosphere is then \nobtained. Brightness temperature can be calculated from the radiance using \nPlank’s function. Horizontally and Vertically polarized radiances are calculated \nseparately because of the difference of their surface emissivity. \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Fig. 1 Schematic Diagram Showing a  Passive Microwave Signal for Rain \nDetection \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n16\n \n \nSome results of the simulation and sensitivity studies are carried out for different \nfrequencies (6.6, 10, 18, 21, 37 and 85 GHz), for various weather conditions that \ninclude raining and non-raining atmosphere and different sea states. Three \ncomponents of the troposphere are important absorbers. Water vapor, liquid water \nand molecular Oxygen. Frequencies where absorption due to molecular Oxygen is \nimportant (roughly 50 to 70 GHz and near 119 GHz) are used for temperature \nsounding but are not often used for rainfall sensing. For our purposes, the \nabsorption due to molecular Oxygen is a minor correction needed to be \nquantitatively correct but not necessary for conceptual understanding.   \n \n2.5.3 Algorithm Description: \nBased on the above brief presentation of the formulation of both emission and \nscattering based radiative transfer, it is highly desirable to create a  data based of \ninput and output field vectors for the algorithm development to estimate rainfall \nusing the MADRAS frequency channels. However the algorithm is required to be \nderived from radiative transfer calculations through an atmospheric cloud model \n(Tripoli et al.1992, Tao et al. 1993) specifying vertical distributions of ice, \ngraupels,  and other liquid hydrometeors as a function of rain rate. Such data base \nfrom cloud resolving models is very rare and is being explored. In liu of this, the \nalgorithm is structured in two main classes. 1. Physically based: based on \nsimulated data base as an advanced R & D and 2. Empirically based, based on the \ncollocated matched data sets of MADRAS and Ground/Ocean truth data from \nvarious sources. Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the rain detection from a \npassive microwave sensor. The Flow diagram is given in Fig. 2 (2.1 and 2.2) \nrespectively. The complete algorithm steps are mentioned below:  \n \n1. Sensitivity studies through simulations of  brightness temperatures for \nMADRAS frequency channels. Till the cloud microphysical data base is \nobtained, the artificially created data base along with ECMWF data will be \nused for radiative transfer simulations following (Liu et al.1998).  \n2. To ascertain the sensitivity of different channels to rainfall and other ocean \nand atmospheric variables, to decouple their influence for using in a rain-\nrate calculations in particular based on the above data base.  \n3. The screening process to distinguish between different land types, raining-\nnonraining background conditions associated with the emission and \nscattering characteristics of hydrometeors etc. using multichannel \nbrightness temperatures from MADRAS (Following Ferraro et al. 1996 for \nSSM/I). \n4. A matched data base of radiometer brightness temperatures and \nground/ocaen rainfall from various sources (TRMM-PR, DWR, AWS, RG \netc.) would be created. Based on the radiative transfer simulations as a \nbench mark, sensitivity studies and screening criterion mentioned above, \nwould be applied to the data. \n5. Following the background conditions and emission and scattering \nassociated with hydrometeors,  separate algorithms for land and oceans \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n17\nwill be developed based on the Scattering Index (SI) Method (by Ferraro et \nal. 1996). \n6. Finally the rain rates will be retrieved using SI along with the collocated \nground/ocean based data following multiple regression and/or Neural \nNetwork approach.  \n7. The resulting rain-rate estimates will be compared to four Doppler \nWeather Radars (DWR) as well as to  buoys and  shipboard measurements \nover a first 6-month period (during calibration/validation phase). \n8. The retrieval algorithm would be attempted for the complete global \nestimates from the MADRAS based on the ground truth data availability \nfrom various continental and oceanic buoy and ship based sources.  \n9. The algorithm will be tested for its accuracy to describe both localized \ninstantaneous rainfall events and global rainfall patterns over both land and \noceans.  \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 2 Flow Diagrams showing the Concept of Rainfall Retrieval: \n \n \n2.5.4 The inverse problem: \n \nIn the last decade, there has been a growing interest in developing rain profile \nretrieval algorithms trained by cloud radiative databases (Smith et al.1994). This \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n18\napproach is based upon the use of radiative transfer models applied to cloud-\nresolving hydrometeor profile outputs. The appeal to develop fast inversion \nalgorithms using pre-generated physically consistent cloud radiative  databases has \nbeen largely exploited for spaceborne microwave radiometry of rainfall (Mugnai \n1988 et al. and Kummero et al. 1996). Following this approach, the accuracy of \nrainfall estimates are basically linked to the accuracy of both forward and inverse \nmodels. In particular, the reliability and consistency of the various radiative transfer \nmodels, used for building retrieval databases, is a crucial problem to be investigated \nwithin this framework. As indicated, the simulations will be carried out as a \nreference bench mark for the proper selection of channels and their combinations. \nThe real data base would be the collocated matched data base of TBs and ground \nbased rainfall measurements.  \nRegarding empirical approach, a matched data sets of the MADRAS radiometric \nobservations will be attempted in conjunction with the ground based observations \nfrom rain gauges, Doppler Weather Radars (DWR) etc. There are a couple of \nempirical approaches that could be attempted for the retrievals. These are simple \nmultiple regressions between the rainfall and the brightness temperatures from \nMADRAS channels. Other methods are based on the SI, PCT and D approaches \nmentioned above section which are highly applicable for the rainfall retrievals. In \norder to demonstrate the applicability of empirical approaches, the existing data of \nTRMM radar and radiometric observations will be utilized and compared with the \nstandard TRMM products of rainfall. The Fig. 3 shows the Logical Flow of \nAlgorithm Development and Validation diagram to be used conceptually. \n \n \n \n \n \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n19\n \n \nFig. 3 Logical Flow of Algorithm Development and Validation \n \n \n2.5.5   Instantaneous Ocean Rainfall \n  \nAs is shown earlier that DOM based Radiative transfer calculations represents \nbetter simulations to determine a brightness temperature, Tb, given a temperature, \nwater vapor and hydrometeor profile. An inversion procedure, however, is needed \nto find a rainfall rate, R, given a brightness temperature Tb. The double valued \nnature of the relations is encountered in 19 to 37 GHz channels as is shown in \nsensitivity section; however it could be resolved by a combination of two or more \nchannels. Since Tbs are sensitive to the vertical structure of precipitation, the \nvertical structure cannot be ignored when instantaneous retrievals are sought. The \nsensitivity to the assumed profile gets larger as the frequency increases and the \nscattering in the upper layers of the cloud begin to play a larger role. The objective \nof the instantaneous rainfall algorithm over ocean is to be achieved using one of \nthe suitable retrieval techniques, such as ANN, MR or Bayesian approach. \nPredefined cloud structures, however, may be utilized to overcome the \nuncertainties in the accuracies of the retrievals. Cloud resolving models such as \nthe Goddard Cumulus Ensemble model (GCE), which is a cloud microphysical \nmodel developed mainly by Tao and Simpson, (1993), or the Tripoli, (1992), \nmodel are used to supply the required cloud structures. For each cloud model time \nstep, radiative transfer computations are supposed to be performed at high \nresolution.  \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n20\nDatabases are generated separately for different freezing heights to capture the \ndifferent \ndynamics of tropical rainfall systems. Once a database of profiles and associated \nbrightness temperatures is established, the retrieval employs a straightforward \ninversion methodology. In the absence of a suitable cloud model data base this \napproach will be taken up as a R & D effort.  \nMeanwhile, for an alternate operational algorithm development, an equally \nworkable approach of the detection of rain over ocean would be employed. \nfollowing For this purpose the data base of TRMM-TMI, and SSM/I radiometric \nTBs will be collocated with TRMM-Precipitation Radar over the global oceans. \nThis data base will be used to develop a robust set of relationships with the SSM/I \nsensor (since the frequency channels and footprints of SSM/I are similar to \nMADRAS compared to TRMM-TMI). A matched data base of SSM/I-TBs and \nbuoy and ship based rainfall would also be created based on the observations all \nover the tropical oceanic regions. \nFurther refinement of the technique is described in Ferraro et al. (1994) and \nFerraro et al. (1998). The rationale was to first develop a relationship which could \nbest predict the 85 GHz Tb under \"nonscattering\" conditions for the ocean surface \nin question. Then, by estimating this value and subtracting the actual 85 GHz Tb, \na measure of the depression due to scattering by precipitation ice/rain drops could \nbe determined. \n \n \nThe form of the Scattering Index method (SI) is as follows: \nWith the seven channels of SSM/I, we name E(19V, 21V)85v as the estimated \nvalue of TB85v by TB19v and TB21v. Based on the data set of rain free areas, we \nwill regress a formula E(19v, 21V)85v as follows, which was used to estimate the \nvalue of TB85v: \n \nE(19V, 21V)85v = a + bTB19v + cTB21v + TB21v2 \n \nIt has been well established (Yao et al. 2001, Mishra et al. 2007) that when it is \nnot raining, E(19V, 21V)85v can represent well the value of TB85v. The Scatering \nIndex over the ocean thus can be defined as the difference between E(19V, \n21V)85v (the estimated value of TB85v) and TB85v (the observed value of TB85v): \n \nSIO = E(19V, 21V)85v –TB85v  \n \nSIO = a + bTb19v + cTb21v + d Tb21222v – Tb85v \n \n where the coefficients a,b,c, and d were derived by assembling a global data set \nof SSM/I observations under scatter-free conditions. Through an exhaustive \nevaluation, it could be found that a threshold SI value could be a good, global \nindicator of rain. A lower threshold does detect more rain; however, it also causes \nthe detection of false alarms to increase. Because snow and deserts can cause a \nsimilar scattering signature, a set of \"screens\" would be developed to remove such \nfeatures based on the screening approach of Ferraro et al. 1996. . The desert check \ninvolves the use of polarization information at 19 GHz, while the separation of \nrain from snow utilizes two relationships involving the Tb at 22 and 85 GHz.  \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n21\nSpecifically, the following type of relationship would be attempted based on PR \nrain rate and SSM/I based SIO   to work best for tropical Indian Ocean and  global \noceanic regions. \n \nRR mm/hr . = a SIOb \n \nThis method to retrieve rain rate would be compared with the standard products of \nrainfall from SSM/I and TRMM. TRMM provides various data sets on rain rates \nover both land and oceans in the form of surface rain rate, total rain in 3 hourly \netc. Similarly SSM/I provides oceanic rain rates  on instantaneous and \naccumulation on daily basis. \n \n2.5.6. Instantaneous Land Rainfall \n \nOver land, rainfall retrievals are far more complex and difficult than oceanic \nretrievals due to the large and variable emissivity of the land surface. Specifically, \nthe high emissivity masks the emission signature that is related directly to the \nwater content in the atmosphere. Instead, only the brightness temperature \ndepression due to scattering in the upper portion of clouds is observed. The \nscattering, as shown in Figure 3, increases with increasing frequencies. \nConsequently, brightness temperature depressions at the 89 GHz channel of \nMADRAS will contain the least ambiguous signal of scattering by ice and/or large \nraindrops. The brightness temperature depression will be converted to an expected \nrainfall rate through the retrieval scheme where databases of hydrometeor profiles \n(associated with a variety of rain systems) will be developed for different \nclimatological zones. Recent results from TRMM indicate that the relationship of \nlightning flashes (which is highly correlated with the 85 GHz scattering signature) \nand rainfall varies over the global land regions. Development of profile databases \nfor different climatological zones can account for regional differences. However, \nas a starting point, we will insure that these retrievals match closely with \nestablished algorithms developed for the SSM/I and TMI sensors. \n  \nA further complication that arises over land is the lack of consistent backgrounds \nagainst \nwhich to compare the Tb depression. To alleviate this problem caused by the \nvarying emissivity associated with changes in surface characteristics (e.g., surface \nwetness, snow \ncover, vegetation, etc.), a rain/no-rain temperature depression threshold is \nrequired. The “screening” issue has always been one of modest controversy in the \nland-based retrievals because of the empirical nature of their form. Intuitively, one \nimmediately thinks that such screens will vary greatly with sensor. However, as is \ndescribed later, these screens (i.e., Tb relationships separating rainfall from other \nsurfaces) seem to hold valid for other sensors, with only minor modifications \nneeded. Additionally, one school of thought in physical retrievals is that the rain \nrate retrieval becomes a two-step process: rain identification and rain rate \ndetermination.  \nThe basis for the retrieval over land comes from the work of Grody (1991), who \ndeveloped a global scattering index (SI) at 85 GHz for use with the SSM/I sensor. \nFurther refinement of the technique is described in Ferraro et al. (1994) and \nFerraro et al. (1998). The rationale was to first develop a relationship which could \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n22\nbest predict the 85 GHz Tb under \"nonscattering\" conditions for the land surface \nin question. Then, by estimating this value and subtracting the actual 85 GHz Tb, \na measure of the depression due to scattering by precipitation ice/rain drops could \nbe determined. The form of the SI is as follows: \n \nSI85v = a + bTb19v + cTb21v + d Tb21222v – Tb85v \n \n where the coefficients a,b,c, and d were derived by assembling a global data set \nof SSM/I observations under scatter-free conditions. Through an exhaustive \nevaluation, Grody (1991) found that an SI value of 10 K or greater was a good, \nglobal indicator of rain. A lower threshold does detect more rain; however, it also \ncauses the detection of false alarms to increase. Because snow and deserts can \ncause a similar scattering signature, a set of \"screens\" were developed to remove \nsuch features. The desert check involves the use of polarization information at 19 \nGHz, while the separation of rain from snow utilizes two relationships involving \nthe Tb at 22 and 85 GHz. \nFerraro et al., (1994), built upon the Grody (1991) study, and developed a more \nrobust set \nof relationships to be used for the detection of rain over land from the SSM/I. In \nthis study, separate relationships were developed for land and ocean, improving \nthe sensitivity to scattering. In addition, the original relationships derived by \nGrody (1991) used antenna temperatures which were convolved to the 19 GHz \nFOV; the updated study used the more conventional Tb values and preserved the \noriginal SSM/I footprint sizes, allowing for easy implementation by the scientific \ncommunity. An alternative method to retrieve rain rate has been to calibrate the SI \nwith ground-based radar measurements from the United States, Japan, and the \nUnited Kingdom (Ferraro and Marks, 1995). Similar to the oceans, the following \nrelationship would be attempted to work best for global oceans: \n \nRR mm/hr . = a SIL\n \nwhere RR is in mm/hr. Since these relationships increase rapidly for higher values \nof SIL, \nany retrieval above 35 mm/hr is set to 35 mm/hr. Although somewhat arbitrary, \npractice \nshows that this is the upward limit of rain rates retrievable from the 85 GHz \nmeasurements (e.g., the maximum mean rain rate that could exist in a 13 by 15 km \nFOV). Using the 10K minimum threshold for the SIL values, the minimum \nretrievable rain rate is approximately 0.5 mm/hr. This algorithm was implemented \nby FNMOC in 1995 as the operational SSM/I rain rate algorithm, and continues to \noperate in that capacity. In addition, the monthly derived rainfall from this \nalgorithm (Ferraro, 1997) is used as a component of the GPCP blended analysis \n(Huffman et al., 1996)The MADRAS instrument will contain nearly similar \nfrequencies to the SSM/I. Initially the SSM/I based coefficients will be used and \nlater fine tuned for MADRAS, based on a large data base to be co-located during \nraining episodes.  \n \n2.6. Operational Implementation: At MOSDAC \n \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n23\n2.7. Outputs:   Rainfall along the sub satellite tracks. \n  \n2.7.1 Format of the output and the domain: TBD \n \n2.8 Validation   \nExtensive validation campaign is required during the first six months of the \nsatellite launch.  To compare retrieved rainfall totals with rainfall totals obtained \nby other satellites like TRMM and SSM/I will be attempted. Some more direct \nmeans, often called \"Ground Truth\", may also be attempted based on the avialility \nof well calibrated data from AWS and DWR’s. The initial six months will be the \ncalibration-validation phase with limited distribution of data. The validation is \npossible with: \n \n1. Other satellite data sets from regional and global sources (land & \nocean). \n2. Rainfall data from well calibrated DWR data from Indian \nMeteorological Department \n \nThe traditional approach has been to take a 2 dimensional rain field derived from \nradar measurements, assume it is constant in the third dimension and use the \nresultant pseudo 3 dimensional rain field for the simulation. This initial averaging \nstep reduces the variability of the rain field and thereby reduces both the value and \nuncertainty of the BFC.   \n \n2.8.1 Data Required \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.8.2  Methods of Validation   \n \nPoint Measurements \nMicro Rain Radars\nThrough Internet\nOrbital & analyzed data\nMADRAS/ TRMM \n/SSM/I Data\nAll daily obs. sites of IMD \n& to plan for oceanic \nlocations\nUsual point \nmeasurements over land \n& oceans\nFast Response Rain \nGauge\nFrom IMD at all DWR \nlocations (every 1-3 \nhours)\n0.250 x 0.250\nDoppler Weather \nRadar\nSource\nResolution\nParameter\nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n24\nThe level 1a and level 1b products are required for above-mentioned approaches for \nthe rainfall retrievals. The database created in an offline process will act as a tool \nfor the algorithm development. During the initial six months of calibration-\nvalidation phase the knowledge of the noise characteristics of the different \nhorizontal and vertical polarization channels will be applied for the improvement of \nthe algorithm. This period will also help in creating a database of ground-based \nnetworks like rain gages, Automatic Weather Stations and Doppler Weather Radars \nin consistency with the MADRAS observations for the empirical algorithm \ndevelopment. The satellite overpasses in and around DWR and rain gauge sites will \nbe utilized for the validation purposes. One complete iteration of TRMM rainfall \nvalidation campaign was exercised using the SHAR and IMD DWR at Chennai \n(Gairola et al. 2004) in a compaign mode. TRMM radar and radiometric \nobservations of rainfall were compared with DWR on various grid scales. This \nneeds to be augmented during the Megha-Tropiques time frame using all the five \nDWRs in the country, AWS and the fast response rain gauges. The error statistics \nwill be generated with a possible feedback mechanism to correct for some biases \netc. to make the algorithm more robust. \n \n2.9 Technical Issues \nFor the instantaneous rainfall error there are some major sources of error: \n \n1) Availability of Cloud resolving model simulations \n2) Coastal boundaries.  \n3) Beam Filling Error \n4) Vertical distribution of Hydrometeors \n5) The freezing level retrieval \n \nThese error sources are very critical and needs to be followed with active groups \nworking at various places elsewhere (in country or abroad). \n \n2.10 Future Scope: \nIn the present document the possibilities of both physical and empirical algorithms \nfor rainfall retrieval are highlighted. However due to certain limitations the \nempirical algorithm has been emphasized as an operational one. It would be based \non the radiatiatve transfer simulations as the pointers to optimize the frequency \nchannels. This is also important in view of the different noise scenario of the \ndifferent channels to be known only after the launch of the satellite. Based on the \nperformance of the algorithm over global tropical ocean and land, the fine tuning \nwill be carried out. The ongoing advanced research on radiative transfer based \nalgorithm will be worked out in future to generate the data base for retrievals. \nHowever, in any case an algorithm would be in place for its global applicability at \npar with the algorithms elsewhere for different satellite sensors like TRMM, \nSSM/I and GPM.  \n \n2.11 Reference \n \n1.

Gohil \nOther Parameters from MT \n3.2 \n Introduction: \nWith the advent of well-calibrated satellite microwave radiometers, it is now \npossible to obtain long time series of geophysical parameters that are important \nfor studying various atmospheric and oceanic processes. In order to strengthen the \nobservation base to provide impetus to the studies concerning tropical processes, \nIndia and France have jointly proposed the Megha-Tropiques (MT) mission. In \naddition to a radiation budget instrument (SCAnner for RAdiative Budget: \nSCRAB), an atmospheric sounding instrument (SAPHIR), and a GPS receiver for \noccultation based profile measurements, the MT mission will also be carrying a \nmicrowave radiometer that designed specifically to measure rainfall and cloud/sea \nice, and also the cloud liquid water, wind speed and water vapor over the global \noceans.  This radiometer is referred as MADRAS (Measurement and Detection of \nrain and Atmospheric Systems). \nMicrowave remote sensing program in ISRO started with the launch of its first \nmicrowave radiometer SAMIR-I onboard Bhaskara-I satellite in 1979 followed by \nsimilar payload SAMIR-II launched onboard Bhaskara-2 satellite in 1981. After a \ngap of nearly two decades, India launched microwave radiometer MSMR onboard \nOceansat-1 (IRS-P4) satellite in May 1999. The MSMR provided the measured \nthe measurements of radiances at 6.6, 10, 19 and 22 GHz channels.  Gohil (1999) \nand Gohil et al. (2000a, 2000b) provided the description of the retrieval \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n30\nalgorithms for geophysical parameters like integrated water vapor (IWV), cloud \nliquid water (CLW), wind speed (WS) and sea surface temperature (SST) from the \nMSMR. Apart from these parameters MSMR was also exploited for rain \nmeasurements (Varma et al., 2002a, Varma et al., 2003, Pokhrel et al., 2003, \nGairola et al, 2004)) even in the severe weather conditions like cyclone (Varma et \nal., 2006). The MSMR derived geophysical parameters were found to be in good \nagreement with ground and the other satellite observations (Varma et al., 2002b). \n \n3.3  Overview and Background \nThis Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) focuses on the MADRAS \nmicrowave radiometer that is scheduled to fly in 2008/2009 on the MT mission. \nMADRAS will measure the Earth’s radiation over the spectral range from 19 to \n157 GHz. over the entire globe within tropics. The channel details and expected \naccuracies are given in the Table 1 (Desbois, 1999). For convenience, we will \nrefer 18.7, 23.8, 36.5, 89 and 157 GHz frequencies as 19, 24, 37, 89 and 157 GHz, \nrespectively.  It will be possible to retrieve the three important geophysical \nparameters, IWV, WS and CLW. Rainfall can also be retrieved, which is \ndiscussed in a separate MT ATBD. The parameters are to be retrieved under the \nnon-raining situations because at the microwave frequencies used for retrieval of \nthe above parameters the emission due to rain is very strong and than obscure the \neffect of the other parameters. The table-2 provides the radiative transfer model \ncalculated change in the brightness temperatures at 19, 21 and 37 GHz frequencies \ndue to 1 mm h-1 of rain rate. It may be noted that a low raining condition of rain \nrate 1 mm h-1, can even change the brightness temperature significantly.  \n \nTable: 1: Megha-tropiques sensor characteristics \nFrequency \nPolarization \nPixel size \nNEDT sensitivity at \n300 K \n18.7 \nV & H \n~ 50 km \n0.5 K \n23.8 \nV (or H) \n~ 40 km \n0.5 K \n36.5 \nV & H \n~ 25 km \n0.5 K \n89 \nV & H \n~ 10 km \n1 K \n157 \nV & H \n~ 6 km \n1 K \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n31\n \n \n \n \nTable 2: Brightness temperature for non-raining and low raining atmosphere. \nFor, SST =300 K, WS = 5 mm s-1, CLW = 20 mg cm-2 \n  \nFor Rain Rate = 0 mm h-\n1 \nFor Rain Rate = 1 mm h-\n1 \ndifference \nTb19 GHz V 216.16 K \n228.57 K \n12.41 K \nTb19 GHz H 160.06 K \n182.40 K \n22.34 K \n21 GHz V \n242.15 K \n251.18 K \n9.03 K \n37 GHz V \n236.27 K \n257.16 K \n20.89 K \n37 GHz H \n188.40 K \n234.07 K \n45.67 K \n  \nThe sensitivity of the geophysical parameters to observing frequency is studied  \nby Wilheit and Chang (1980). The study indicates high sensitivity for SST only at \nfrequencies < 10 GHz. Hence the SST retrieval from MADRAS is not included in \nthis document. The wind has high senstivity at 19 and 37 GHz channels but these \nchannels are also affected by water vapor and cloud liquid water in the \natmosphere. Gohil et al. (2000a) have shown that inclusion of lower frequency \nchannels (6 GHz) in the wind retrieval algorithm improves the accuracy. This is \nmainly due to less influence of the water vapor and cloud liquid water on the \nlower frequency channels. Due to the absence of 10 and 6 GHz channels on \nMADRAS, wind retrieval accuracy will be slightly poorer compared to MSMR or \nTMI. The rms accuracies given in Table 3 come from SSM/I experience. We are \nhopeful that the retrieval accuracies for IWV, WS, and CLW will be almost \nsimilar to that available from SSM/I due to nearly identical lower frequency \nchannels which are used for retrieval of the parameters being discussed in this \ndocument. However, the radiometer noise is crucial to achieve this accuracy.   \n \nTable -3: RMS error budget for retrieved parameters from SSM/I (Wentz, 1997) \nRetrieval` Atmospheric \nModel \nWind \nDirection \nRadiometer \nNoise \nSampling \nMismatch \nOther \nTotal \nObserved \nIWV \n0.81 \n0.21 \n0.43 \n3.68 \n0.74 \n3.87 \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n32\n(m/s) \nWS (mm) \n0.51 \n0.35 \n0.53 \n0.94 \n0.41 \n1.31 \nCLW \n(mm) \n0.019 \n0.004 \n0.007 \n0 \n0.014 \n0.025 \n \n3.4  Objectives:  \n \n Development of Algorithms for the retrieval of Integrated Water Vapor, \nCloud Liquid Water and Wind Speed over oceans from Mega-Tropiques \nMADRAS. \n \n3.5 Inputs \n \n3.5.1  Static Data \n \nWe need following datasets for the retrieval of  GPs.

Algorithm Functional Specifications: \n \n3.6.1: Theoretical background \n \nRadiative Transfer Model \nThe brightness temperature received by microwave radiometer looking towards \nearth in non-scattering atmosphere in a thermodynamic equilibrium is given by:  \n \nTb(,p) = TbDN () (1-(Ts, ,p)) +Ts (Ts, ,p) ()+TbUP \n \nWhere, Tbν = brightness temperature measured at frequency ν \n \nTbDN = downwelling radiances \n \nTbUP = upwelling radiances \n \n= frequency of observation \n \n = angle of incidence \n \n = transmittance \n \n = emissivity \n \nTs = surface temperature \n \np = polarization \n \nTbDN\nTbUP\nSurface\nTs, \nTb\nTbS\n\n\n \nFig. 1 \nThe total brightness temperature has three components as mentioned in expression \nabove and also in Fig. 1. First, the emitted radiation by the atmosphere directly \nreaching to the radiometer which mainly depends upon the absorption by \natmospheric constituents like dominantly absorbing gases (oxygen and water \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n34\nvapor) and the hydrometeors (water drops of cloud and rain). Second, the \natmospheric radiation reaching the earth surface and gets reflected by it and \nreaches to the radiometer after having attenuated by the intervening atmosphere. \nThird, the radiation emitted by the earth surface after attenuated by the intervening \natmosphere reaches to the radiometer. Thus, the total radiation received by the \nradiometer is affected by both atmosphere and earth surface. \n \nWe propose to use the standard stat-of-art radiative transfer models from Florida \nState University (Liu, 1998).  In Liu’s model the absorption models by \nRosenkranz (1998) for oxygen and Rosenkranz (1993) for water vapour are used. \nAbsorption due to non precipitating cloud is calculated using the model given by \n(Paris, 1971). The clouds will be simulated as given in the next paragraph. Liu’s \nmodel (1992) utilizes Guillon et al. (1998) for calculating the ocean surface \nemissivity. The brightness temperatures thus simulated from the known \natmospheric and surface geophysical variables are used to establish suitable \nstatistical or physiostatistical relationships between them and atmpsheric \nparameters for retrieval purpose. \n \nMasking the rainy area \nA radiative transfer based method for rain identification over global oceans is \ndeveloped prior the launch of the Megha-Tropiques satellite to avoid the retrieval \nof other GPs over oceans. The scheme is based on developing step-by-step \nprocedures for transforming MADRAS based scattering index (SI) to equivalent \nSSM/I based scattering index with high accuracy (Varma et al., 2011).   \n \nFerraro and Mark (1995) and Ferraro et al. (1996) provided a rain identification \nand retrieval algorithm over land and oceans. Their algorithm is based on \nempirical relationship between rain rate and scattering index which is originally \nproposed by Grody (1991). The Ferraro and Mark (1995) algorithm is developed \nfor SSM/I channels and is not directly portable to MADRAS which is having \ndifferent sensor characteristics. According to Grody (1991), scattering index (SI) \nis defined as depression in the SSM/I 85 GHz V polarized Tb (Tb85V) due to \nscattering in the presence of rain. They calculated the depression by taking the \ndifference between observed rain-affected Tb85V and its expected value (Fs) \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n35\nunder rain free conditions. The expected Tb85V (Fs) under rain free conditions is \nworked out by establishing a relationship between SSM/I Tbs at 85.5 GHz V and \nat 19.35 GHz V & H and 22.23 GHz V channels that are essentially emission \nchannels and are considered not to be affected by scattering. The relationship that \nthey proposed for scattering index (SI) is as follows: \n \nSI = Fs – TbiV,                   \n \nwhere, TbiV is Tb from high frequency 85.5 GHz V polarized SSM/I channel, and \nFs is expected TbiV under rain free conditions. The Fs is defined as,  \nFs= a1*Tb1+a2*Tb2+a3*Tb3+a0    \n \nThese coefficients for SSM/I and MADRAS are calculated using radiative transfer \nsimulated database of brightness temperatures under raining and non-raining \nconditions.  This is shown schematically in Fig. 2 below.  \n \n \n \nFig. 2: Scheme for simulation of brightness temperatures for SSM/I and \nMADRAS using NCEP environment fields and finding regression relation \nfor expected brightness temperature at 85.5 GHz (SSM/I) / 89 GHz \n(MADRAS).  \n \nIn the next step a regression based relationship is established between SI (SSM/I) \nand SI (MADRAS). This relationship is used to estimate expected SI (SSM/I) for \ngiven SI (MADRAS). According to Ferraro and Mark (1995) and Ferraro et al. \n(1996), rain is expected when SI > 10. We use the same value of SI for identifying \nrain event. \n \nCloud Liquid Water Masking: \nSimulation of Tbs for SSMI \nover oceans \nSimulation of Tbs for MT \nover oceans \nNCEP GDAS \nModel fields \nwithin ±30o \nLatitudes \nFs (SSM/I) \nFs (MADRAS) \nIncluding SSM/I sensor \ncharacteristics \nIncluding MADRAS sensor \ncharacteristics \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n36\nThe high amount of CLW affects less to TPW retrieval but more to WS retrieval \nfor WS being a surface parameter (Wentz, 1997). We therefore restrict the CLW \nvalue for the retrieval of the TPW and WS to 50 mg cm-2 and 18 mg cm-2, \nrespectively (Wentz, 1997). Thus if CLW exceeds these thresholds values, the \nTPW and WS are not retrieved. \n \nInversion Techniques: \nInversion techniques that are proposed to be employed have their heritage from \nMSMR, are essentially statistical techniques in which relationships between the \npredictors and the predictants are established. A general inversion technique is \nmathematically represented by the following expression: \n\n\nTb\nD\nG\n\n*\n\n \nHere, G is a vector whose elements are various geophysical parameters which is \nrelated to a measurement basis function vector φ(Tb) of simulated brightness \ntemperatures Tb by a matrix D. The measurement basis function vector contains \nthe elements which could either be pure or functions of TB. The matrix D is given \nby: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,\n,\n1\n\n\n\nC\nC\nD\n \nwhere C is a correlation matrix and is obtained from geophysical variables' \nstatistics.  \nSeparate inversion coefficients are established for each geophysical variable. \nDifferent combinations of channels and polarization are required for different \nvariable as the dependence of brightness temperature on these variables is \ndifferent. Sensitivity studies and effect of errors in measurements on retrieval is \nalso required for finalization of suitable combinations. \n \nEffect of Sensor-Satellite System errors on retrievals: \nAs seen above that the retrieval coefficient matrix D is dependent on geophysical \nparameters as well as on the corresponding simulated brightness temperatures, the \nmatrix D is affected by chosen statistics of geophysical parameters and on various \nerrors in the brightness temperatures typical of a particular radiometer system and \nsatellite attitude. It is always better for a stable retrieval to include the wide \nstatistics of geophysical parameters and to account for various errors in the \nmeasurements of brightness temperatures by a radiometer and satellite attitude. \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n37\nThe dominant errors in the brightness temperature measurements are the system \nnoise at antenna and radiometer system, calibration, uncertainties in knowing the \nactual measurement geometry (viz. incidence angle and polarization etc). Thus \nknowledge of total error in measurements is must for establishing the retrieval \nmatrix which enables to provide better estimates of geophysical parameters with \nknown errors as far as possible. The point to be noted here is that the retrieval will \nhave errors in geophysical estimates from the erroneous data; however, the errors \nwill be still more if we underestimate the overall error in brightness temperature \nand use such retrieval matrix D with actual data having even higher errors. On the\n \nother hand, the errors will also be more in parameters retrieved with matrix \nD established using overestimated errors and using it with less erroneous data. \nTherefore, it is must to know the true behavior of radiometer, system in terms of \ntotal error in brightness temperatures and the biases in the measurements. The \nnext step is to fine-tune the retrieval matrix using the insitu data widely spread \nover space and time. Moreover, the theoretical errors (mostly of non-random \nnature) due to radiative transfer model are taken care by fine tuning of retrieval \nmatrix through validation data. \n \nGeneral Form of Retrieval Algorithms for MADRAS \nThe MADRAS retrieval algorithms for various geophysical parameters would \nhave the following general form: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\ni\ni\ni\no\nTb\nf\nc\nc\nG\n1\n \nwhere, G = Desired geophysical parameter (WS, IWV, CLW), and co & ci = \nretrieval coefficients for parameter G for ith channel \nPost-Launch Scenario  \nAfter MT-MADRAS is launched and the collocated in situ data are available, we \nwill calibrate the pre-launch algorithm by making small adjustments to the \ncoefficients of the retrieval algorithms presented in section 3.5. This will be \ncarried out based on validation results. \n \n \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n38\n3.6.2  Flow chart \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 3 \n \n3.7 Outputs \n \nThe output units, range and also the theoretical accuracy based on simulation \nresults is as follows: \nTable -5 \n \nParameter \nUnit \nMin \nMax \nAccuracy \nResolution \nIWV \ngm cm-2 \n0 \n10 \n0.48 g/cm2 \nPixel \nWS \nm s-1 \n0 \n25 \n1.60 m/s \nPixel \nCLW \nmg cm-2 \n0 \n600 \n5.32 \nmg/cm2 \nPixel \n3.7.1 Format of the output and the domain \nThe output format is as follows (Table 6): \nAtmospheric Profiles, \nSST, WS \nRT Model \nSimulated data set of \nTbs \nDevelopment of statistical relationship \nbetween Tbs and the GPs \nTb measurements from \nMT \nRetrieval of GPs using \nrelationships derived  \nSenstivity \nstudy of GPs \nwith Tbs \nInstrument \nError budget \nTheoretical Accuracy of \nthe retrieval algorithms \nComparison with insitu  \nPost launch accuracy \nafter fine tuning \nFine tuning \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n39\n \nTable -6 \nName and Description \nType value \nOutput file name \nSame as input file name with extension replaced by \n“gp.txt” \nOutput file containing \nLatitude, longitude, day, \nhour, \nmin, \nseconds, \nCLW, TPW, WS and \nFlag \nLatitude, longitude, day, hour, min, seconds from input \nfile \nCLW range 0-600 mg cm-2,   \nTPW range > 0-10 g cm-2,   \nWS range > 0 – 25 m s-1,  \nPossible Flag values:  \n0:  good retrievals with ranges specified above,  \n1: one or more Tbs out-of range; All GPs set to -99.99,  \n2: Surface type not oceanic; All GPs set to -99.99,  \n3: Rain present; All GPs set to -99.99,  \n4: CLW > 50 mg cm-2; TPW and WS set to -99.99,  \n5: CLW > 18 mg cm-2; WS set to -99.99,  \n6: One of the GPs exceeding valid range and set to -\n99.99 \n \n3.8 Validation \nA separate ATBD for validation is submitted.

We hope to achieve the \naccuracies as provided for SSM/I. In view of our past experience of deriving the \nsame parameters using MSMR observation, we do not foresee any practical \ndifficulty in deriving the same using MT-MADRAS. The derived parameters need \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n40\nto be validated   extensively over different regions and seasons of the year so that \ncomplete dynamic range of the parameters could be validated. We expect a \nseparate team will be looking for the validation aspect. We, however, need their \nfeedback for fine tuning the retrieval algorithms in the post launch phase. \n3.10 Future Scope \nRetrieval algorithms have to be validated and then if necessary fine tuning of the \nalgorithms have to be carried out.  This will be done by adjusting the coefficients \nin the D-matrix by minimizing the errors between observations and the \nestimations. \n3.11 References \nAlishouse, J.C., S. Synder, J.

From this orbit; the satellite \nis able to collect frequent data over the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone to \ncomplement and augment those obtained by satellites in geostationary and polar \norbits. The MT satellite payloads are high-technology sensors viz. Microwave \nAnalysis and Detection of Rain and Atmospheric Structures (MADRAS), a \nmillimeter wave humidity profiler (SAPHIR), an optical-IR radiometer for \nradiation budget (ScaRAB) and a radio occultation sensor (GPS-ROS). All the \nsensors have been integrated with IRS platform and primarily developed under \nISRO-CNES joint collaboration. \n4.2.1 Overview and background: \nThe Sondeur Atmosphérique du Profil d'Humidité Intertropicale par Radiométrie \n(SAPHIR) instrument is developed by IPSL and Observatoire de Paris as part of \nthe MEGHA-TROPIQUES payload to study the vertical distribution of water \nvapour in the tropical troposphere, with two specific objectives: \n \n1. Analysis of the diurnal cycle of the water vapour distribution, to evaluate the \nvertical   transports associated with convective structures at the mesoscale and the \nlarge scale, and to understand the scale-to-scale interactions in the meridional flux \n2. Study of the role of the space-time distribution of humidity on the development \nof deep convection. \n \nAn additional aim is to improve parameterizations of humidity related processes \nin AGCM. The need for such an instrument on the Megha Tropiques platform was \ndriven by the following main reasons: \n \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n45\na) Scarcity of accurate and frequent water vapour profile measurements in tropical      \nlatitudes for studying convective system life cycle. \nb) Existing and other future sounders are planned to be onboard polar orbiting \nsatellites   leading to heterogeneous data. \n4.2.2 Objectives \n \n To retrieve humidity profile in 6 layers of the atmosphere from \n1000 to 100 mb. \n To validate the retrieved profiles with concurrent radiosonde, \nsatellites observations and NWP model fields. \n To improve the retrievals based on the validation feedback. \n4.3 \nInstrument characteristics: \nSix SAPHIR channels are centered on major water vapour absorbing band at \n183.31 GHz. The following table shows the details of its bandwidths etc. \n \nTable1: SAPHIR Channels characteristics \n \n \n4.4 \nInputs: \n4.4.1 Static Data  \n \nParameter \nResolution \nAccuracy \nSource \nLand /Sea Mask  Pixel ( ~4 km) \n1 pixel \n USGS \n \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n46\n \n4.4.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) \nParameter \nResolution \nQuantization \nAccuracy \nSource \nRadiometric \nand geometric \ncorrected \nbrightness \ntemperatures  \nof 6 SAPHIR \nchannels  \nEach pixel \n/Grid \n16-bit \n<1K \nDerived \nfrom raw \ndata by DP \nGeolocation of \nall the \nSAPHIR \nchannels \nEach pixel/ \nGrid \n16-bit \n1 pixel \nDerived by \nDP \nGeolocated \nTotal Water \nvapour \nContent from \nMADRAS \nEach Pixel/ \nGrid \n16-bit \n \nDerived by \nMADRAS \nAlgorithm \n \nQuality \nFlag(surface, \ngeo-location \nquality, BT \nvaliditity) \nEach Pixel \n16-bit \n \nProvided by \nDP \n \n4.5 \nAlgorithm functional specifications \n4.5.1 Basic principle \nThe scientific objective of SAPHIR calls for determination of humidity with an \naccuracy of 10 to 20% in 6 layers of the troposphere with 10 km of spatial \nresolution.  For realizing that goal, it is necessary to choose channels for which the \natmospheric contribution to the radiance comes from different levels of the \ntroposphere.  This can be obtained by sampling an absorption line of water vapour \nby channels more or less close to the centre of the line.  A candidate line, already \nchosen for other instruments, is the line at 183.3 GHz.  It is possible to get \ncontribution functions peaking from heights of 2 km up to 12 km in tropical \natmospheres.  However, the width of the contribution functions makes it \nredundant to use more than 5 channels.  A sixth complementary channel, in a \nwindow region, has to be used to correct for the surface effects in the lower \nchannels. \nThe SAPHIR humidity sounder operates at six channels around 183.31 GHz \ndesignated as S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 and S6. given in Table-1.The final selection of \nlayers is carried out by first building a learning data base, consisting of \nmeteorological profiles, and brightness temperatures simulated by running a \nradiative transfer model on the profiles; then a multiple regression  inversion \nscheme is applied to retrieve the humidity in each layer. \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n47\n \n \nFigure 1b: Weighting functions of the 6 SAPHIR channels for a mean \ntropical atmosphere over sea, at nadir.

Tbup, TBdn are upwelling and down-welling \natmospheric brightness temperatures. The models used are those of Liebe (1993) \nfor atmospheric absorption, Hollinger (1973) for calm, Stogryn (1972) for wind \nroughened and Wilheit (1979) for foam covered sea surface emissivity, \nrespectively. Low frequency wing of SAPHIR channels have been considered for \nthe simulations of brightness temperatures. \nFor the microwave frequencies in the resonance region of dominant absorbers like \nwater vapour and oxygen, the transmittance is very low or negligible so that the \ncontribution to the total radiation to the radiometer by reflected down-welling and \nsurface radiations becomes negligible. Therefore, the total brightness temperature \nis expressed as \n \n                                         (6) \n \nThe product of absorption due to a thin atmospheric layer and the transmittance of \nthe overlying atmosphere is known as the weighting function as given below \n \n                                                                                                    \n                                                                                                                           (7) \n \nwith  \n \n \nThe profile of weighting function with altitude is characterized by the absorption \nprofile for a specific frequency. The weighting function profile has a peak at a \nparticular altitude for a particular frequency in resonance region. This implies the \nmaximum sensitivity of a channel at the peak altitude of weighting function. This \nforms the basis for the sounding of the atmosphere at various altitudes using \ndifferent channels in the resonance region. On the other hand, the radiation \nreceived by the radiometer is the weighted contribution by different layers of the \natmosphere with maximum contributions from the layers having peak weighting \nfunction. The peak of the weighting function shifts towards higher altitude as the \nchannel frequency nears the resonance line of an absorber. Contrary to it, the peak \nof weighting function shifts towards surface for transparent or window channels \nand the atmospheric contributions also reduce to greater extents. The window \nchannels are used for surface sensing. \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n49\n \n4.5.1.2 Retrieval techniques: \nThe sensitivity of simulated brightness temperatures on humidity has been studied \nunder varying atmospheric conditions. This experiment is useful in selecting the \natmospheric thick-overlapping layers (TOL) influencing maximum number of \nchannels to be considered for better retrievals. Additionally, these TOL  are also \ninnovatively utilized to derive humidity for thin-isolated layers (TIL) which \notherwise will have large retrieval errors when directly derived from the channel \nbrightness temperatures (due to broad overlapping nature of channel’s Weighting \nFunctions (WFs) as shown in Figure 1b). Retrieval has been performed for the 7 \nTOL’s lying between the pressure values (1000-550) mb, (1000-400) mb, (850-\n400) mb, (850-250) mb, (700-250) mb, (700-100) mb and (550-100) mb \nrespectively on the basis of their sensitivity with SAPHIR chennels’ brightness \ntempratures. From these seven TOL’s, the LARH for six TIL’s lying between \npressure values (1000-850) mb, (850-700) mb, (700-550) mb, (550-400) mb, \n(400-250) mb, and (250-100) mb have been derived. \n \nDefinitions of the TOL and TIL are given below. \n \nThe layer-average relative humidity (LARH) for TOL is the relative humidity \n(RH) averaged with respect to logarithm of pressure over a layer between two \npressure limits “p1” and “p2” as defined below  \n \n                 (8) \n \nAs mentioned above, thin-isolated layers (TILs) have also been derived from two \nThick-overlapping layers (TOLs) as follows.

Sathiyamoorthy \nBipasha Paul Shukla \nATBD for top of atmosphere \nradiance-to-flux computation \n5.2 \nIntroduction \nAn understanding of the radiation budget of the earth is fundamental because the \nweather/climate system is a heat engine, with absorbed solar radiation being the \nenergy source and Earth-emitted radiation being the energy sink necessary to \ndrive the system. Earth Radiation Budget studies are of paramount importance in \nthe context of global climate change. The delicate balance of the incoming and the \noutgoing radiation, which is being disturbed by anthropogenic activities, mark \ntheir signatures in the top of atmosphere radiation budget quantities. Top of \natmosphere radiation budget quantities can be estimated from satellites using well-\ncalibrated broadband radiometers.  \n \nScanner for Radiation Budget (ScaRaB) onboard Megha-Tropiques is a 4-channel \ncross-track scanning radiometer. The four channels include two broad spectral \nbands (Channel-2 and Channel-3) from which the reflected shortwave and emitted \nlongwave radiances are derived and two narrow bands (Channel-1 and Channel-4) \none corresponding to the infrared atmospheric window, other to the visible (green \nto red) portion of the solar spectrum (Table.1). Purpose of keeping the two narrow \nband channels are: (i) R&D activities and (ii) estimate the errors associated with \nthe narrow band to broad band extrapolations. \n \nTable-1 ScaRaB Channels \nChannel  \nNo. \nDescription \nWavelength Range \n1 \nVisible (VIS) \n0.55 - 0.65 m \n2 \nSolar (SW) \n0.2 – 4.0 m \n3 \nTotal (T) \n0.2 – 100 m \n4 \nIR Window (IR) \n10.5 – 12.5m \n \nSatellite measurement of the earth–atmosphere radiations are usually confined to \ncertain local times and specific directions of view depending on orbital constraints \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n56\nand instrument scanning capabilities. Due to the smaller spatial view of the \nScaRaB, only limited angular coverage is possible by each observation. In the \ncase of ScaRaB, the direct measurement is radiance while the desired \nmeasurement is radiative flux at the top of atmosphere.  Derivation of the radiative \nflux using the ScaRaB radiance observations then requires the use of measured \nsatellite radiances and assumptions about the anisotropy of the earth’s radiation \nfield. The primary modification of the earth’s anisotropy is caused by the \nvariations in cloud properties. In this document details about the ScaRaB/Megha-\nTropiques data processing system that can compute top of atmosphere shortwave \n(SW) and Longwave (LW) fluxes from measured radiances is described. \n \n5.2.1 Overview and Background: \nThe ScaRaB/Megha-Tropiques data processing system corresponds to the ERBE-\nlike data processing system, already used and assessed by the former ERBE, \nScaRaB and CERES experiments. In this system, the ‘maximum likelihood \nestimation’ algorithm (Wielicki and Green, 1989) is used for scene identification. \nThe 12-scene classification is based on five geo-types [ocean, land, snow-ice, \ndesert and coast] and four cloud types [clear, partly cloudy, mostly cloudy and \novercast]. The raw radiances are first corrected for spectral filtering effects as a \nfunction of identified scene. Next scene-type dependent angular correction models \n(anisotropic factor from Suttles et al, 1988; 1989) are used to deduce the SW and \nLW fluxes of the pixel as a function of measured radiances. \n \n \nThree important steps involved in the ScaRaB radiance to flux computation are: \n \n1. Spectral correction \n \n2. Scene Identification and \n3. Flux computation (by applying scene-type dependent ADM). \n \n5.2.1.1 Spectral Correction \nThe calibrations of the filtered radiances LTf  and LSWf    are normalized to precise \nradiation sources: blackbodies at temperature respectively 310 K and 5800 K. \nThen the unfiltered radiances are equal to filtered radiances only if the observed \ntargets have similar or proportional emission spectra.   Otherwise the unfiltered \nradiances are calculated from the filtered radiances \n \nscene\nf\nscene\nscene\nF\nL\nL\n\n  \n \n \n \n-- (1) \n \nwhere Fscene is the filtering factor, varying around 1 according to the spectral shape \nor colour of the scene.  \n5.2.1.2 Scene Identification \nUnlike the CERES instrument on TRMM, Aqua and Terra missions, the \nScaRaB/MeghaTropiques will not have an imager payload for scene \nidentification. To identify the scene, the indirect ERBE scene identification \nmethod (Wieliecki et al., 1989) will be utilized.  This is a statistical approach \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n57\ncalled Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) technique and uses only the \nunfiltered LLW and LSW radiances measured by ScaRaB for scene identification. \n \n \n5.2.1.2.1 ERBE Angular Model \nBoth the scene identification and the flux computation use the ERBE Angular \nDependence Model (ADM) generated by Suttles et al. (1989). From statistical \nanalysis of  satellite measurement (mainly seven months of Nimbus 7 radiance \nmeasurements), the radiance anisotropy is described for 12 scene types, \ncombination of 5 geo-types and 4 cloud cover categories (Table 2). In the LW, the \nADM depends on latitude and season. The ADM are not continuous functions of \nthe angles, but discrete values corresponding to the angular intervals. \n  \nTable-2 ERBE 12-Scene types \nNo. \nScene Type \nCloud \nFraction (%) \n1 \nClear Ocean \n0-5 \n2 \nClear Land \n0-5 \n3 \nClear snow/ice \n0-5 \n4 \nClear Desert \n0-5 \n5 \nCoastal \n0-5 \n6 \nPartly cloudy ocean \n5-50 \n7 \nPartly cloudy land \n5-50 \n8 \nPartly cloudy coastal \n5-50 \n9 \nMostly cloudy ocean \n50-95 \n10 \nMostly cloudy Land \n50-95 \n11 \nMostly cloudy coastal \n50-95 \n12 \nOvercast \n95-100 \n \n \nIn the following, subscript Mod stands for Modelled (ADM). \nR is the LW anisotropy function \n  is the SW anisotropic function (bidirectional reflection) \n \nThe LW ADM contains: \n1.

In the LW/SW \ngraph (Figure-1), the centre of the ellipse represents the average SW-LW \nradiances and the areas describe the standard deviation. The cloud fraction of a \nmeasurement is determined by its location on this plane. For each ScaRaB \nmeasured SW-LW pair, probabilities for being each case are calculated. The \nhighest probability identifies the cloud fraction.   \n \nFigure-1:  Equiprobability Ellipses for MLE. Clr (clear), PC (partly cloudy), MC \n(mostly cloudy), OV (overcast).

GPS-Radio Occultation (GPS-RO) based retrieval of these atmospheric \nparameters is a relatively novel approach to limb sounding technique, with the \nconstellation of GPS satellites and deployed Low Earth Orbit (LEO) receiver/s \nconstituting its gross measurement system.  \nROSA, onboard MEGHA-TROPIQUES, is the deployed GPS receiver in context \ntracking L-band dual-frequency signals transmitted by GPS satellites.  \nOperating frequency \nSpecification \n \nL1 C/A code signal \nL1 P-code signal \nL2 P-code signal \n \n1575.42 MHz \n1575.42 MHz \n1227.60 MHz \n \nThe orbital specification of Megha-Tropiques combined with ROSA receiver \nspecification, is likely to result in occultation event frequency in excess of 500 per \nday with spatial coverage from 30S – 30N latitude. Multiple space-based GPS \nreceivers are configured to give increased occultation events. Currently, COSMIC, \nwhich is a constellation of six receivers, is a multiple-receiver mission yielding \nbetween 1800-2500 occultations per day and a dense coverage of mid-latitude \nregion.  \nThis document is primarily concerned with the delineation and description of \nconceptual constructs in the retrieval of afore-mentioned geophysical parameters \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n68\nfrom GPS-RO derived refractivity and the associated elements in development of \nthe algorithm for the same and its operational implementation. A meaningful \nstarting point for this purpose is the relationship, also called forward model, \nbetween the derived refractivity and geophysical parameters to be retrieved viz. \ntemperature (T), pressure (P) and water vapor partial pressure (e). However, a \nbrief overview of the theoretical background of the GPS-RO technique, beginning \nwith the raw measurements to the derivation of refractivity, is given for greater \ncomprehension and continuity. \n \n6.2.1 Theoretical Background \nThe basic observables of this technique are the phase and amplitude of the dual-\nfrequency signals transmitted by a GPS satellite and received by the LEO receiver \nin an occulting geometry as depicted in Fig.1. The recorded phase, corresponding \nto a single frequency, is the sum of vacuum phase and an excess phase, due to the \nintervening atmosphere. Obtaining excess phase delay involves precise \nmeasurement of GPS and LEO satellite orbits (position and velocities) and phase \ndelays of GPS signals (at L1 and L2 frequencies) to a very high accuracy. From \nthe time series of excess phase delay (obtained after removing vacuum phase \ndelay from measured phase delay) and position and velocities of GPS and LEO, \nbending angle profile as a function of impact parameter is computed.       \n                                        \n \nFigure 1. A schematic diagram of radio occultation sounding geometry \nThe main steps involved in the retrieval of refractivity and related atmospheric \nparameters are as follows (Steiner et al., 1999):  \n1. Calculation of the atmospheric bending angle profile from the observed \nL1/L2 excess phase path time series (including dual-frequency ionospheric \ncorrection). \n2. Retrieval of the refractive index profile from the atmospheric bending \nangle profile and conversion to refractivity profile. \n3. Calculation of pressure, and temperature based on the refractivity profile \n(assuming dry air). The pressure and temperature so calculated are the dry \npressure and dry temperature, distinct from real pressure and temperature \nin the water vapor dominant region (i.e. lower troposphere). \n4. Deriving water vapor partial pressure with a simultaneous refinement of \ndry temperature and pressure to get real state parameters.  \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n69\n6.2.1.1 Bending angle calculation: \nGPS-LEO occultation geometry defining the atmospheric bending angle (), the \nimpact parameter (a), and the radius of the ray tangent point (r) is shown in Figure \n1. The impact parameter (a) is defined, assuming spherical symmetry, as the \nperpendicular distance between the center of the Earth (more precisely the center \nof local curvature at the perigee of the occultation ray) and the ray asymptote at \nthe GPS or LEO satellite. The atmospheric Doppler shift, f, can be related to the \ndirection of the transmitted and received signals by the expression \n]ˆ\n).\n(\nˆ.\nˆ.\n[\nk\nv\nv\nk\nv\nk\nv\nf\ndt\nd\nr\nt\nr\nr\nt\nt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    (1) \nvt and vr – the transmitter (GPS) and receiver’s (LEO) velocity respectively. \nkt and kr – unit vectors in the direction of transmitted and received signal, \nrespectively. \nkˆ  - Unit vector in the direction from the transmitter to the receiver. \nEquation (1) is difference of Doppler shift observed in the presence of the \natmosphere and the Doppler shift that would be observed for the same transmitter-\nreceiver geometry in the absence of the atmosphere. The first order relativistic \ncontributions to the Doppler are identical in the two situations and cancel out. \nEquation (1) holds for atmosphere of any shape. However, (1) also has infinite \nnumber of solutions, since kt and kr are unknown, corresponding to four \nindependent parameters. Therefore, certain assumptions have to be made on the \nshape of the atmosphere in order to derive the atmospheric bending from equation \n(1).To a good approximation, the neutral atmosphere is spherically symmetric. In \norder to account for the ellipticity of the Earth, the center of symmetry is taken to \ncorrespond to the circle of occultation plane which best fits the geoid near the \ntangent point. With the spherical symmetry assumption, equation (1) reduces to \ntwo equations in two unknowns  \n)\ncos\ncos\n(\n))\ncos(\n)\ncos(\n(\nr\nr\nt\nt\nr\nr\nr\nt\nt\nt\nv\nv\nv\nv\ndt\nd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2(a)                                \n)\nsin(\n)\nsin(\nr\nr\nr\nr\nt\nt\nt\nt\nn\nr\nn\nr\na\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n                                      2(b) \nEquation 2(b) is Bouger’s law (equivalent to Snell’s law in a spherically \nsymmetric medium). \nrr  and rt are the vectors from the center of curvature to transmitter and receiver, \nrespectively; rr =| rr|, rt=| rt| and nr and nt are indices of refraction at the transmitter \nand receiver, respectively. \n \nFigure 2. Occultation geometry defining the angles used in equations 2(a, b). \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n70\n \nAt the heights of the transmitter (~ 20000 km) and receiver (low earth orbit), the \nindices of refraction are assumed to be equal to 1. This approximation can be \nshown to introduce a very small error in the estimated bending in the ionosphere \nand it cancels completely after doing ionospheric calibration to estimate neutral \natmospheric bending. The angles t and r are determined by simultaneously \nsolving equations 2(a) and 2(b) (easily accomplished using Newton’s method and \na first guess of t=0 and r=0). The total bending angle is =t+r and the \ncorresponding impact parameter ‘a’ is obtained by equation 2(b). \nIf 1(a1) and 2(a2) be the bending angle as a function of the asymptotic miss \ndistance for the L1 and L2 signals, respectively, then the linear combination  \n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n0\n2\n2\n2\n2\n1\n2\n2\n0\n1\n2\n2\n2\n1\n2\n1\n0\na\nf\nf\nf\na\nf\nf\nf\na\nneut\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  (3), \nwhere 1 and 2 are interpolated to the same value of a0, removes first-order \nionospheric bending (which is proportional to f  -2). The calibration should not \ncontinue above a certain height, when the neutral atmosphere signature on the \nocculted signal is comparable to residual ionospheric effects or the receiver’s \nthermal noise. \nDeeper in the atmosphere, due to defocusing effects and the weakening of the \nsignal, the L2 signal is not used when the signal to noise ratio drops below a \ncertain limit. In that case, an extrapolation of the ionosphere correction is used \nfrom higher altitudes to correct for the ionosphere (Hocke 1997, Hocke et al., \n1997). \n6.2.1.2 Retrieval of refractive index profile: \nInverse Abel transform technique is used to retrieve refractive index profile from \nbending angle profile (Hajj et al., 1995; Kursinski et al., 1996; Hocke 1997). \nBending angle i(ai) and the refractive index n at the perigee location of the ray is \ngiven by the forward Abel transform (e.g. Fjeldbo et al., 1971):  \n2\n2\n(\n)\n(ln\n2\ni\na\nx\ni\ni\na\nx\ndx\ndx\nn\nd\na\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n                                       (4) \nUsing inverse Abel transform, refractive index (n) is given as: \ndx\na\nx\nx\na\nn\na\n\n\n\n2\n2\n)\n(\n1\n))\n(\nln(\n\n\n \n                                                  (5) \nThe upper limit of integral equation (5) requires knowledge of bending angle as a \nfunction of impact parameter up to the top of the atmosphere. In practice however, \nthe estimated bending is reasonably accurate only up to a certain upper height, au. \nThe refractivity profile is calculated by upward scaling of refractive index profile \nas:        \n6\n10\n)1\n)\n(\n(\n)\n(\n\n\n\na\nn\na\nN\n                                                                        (6) \nThe refractivity, derived as a function of impact parameter, is redefined on a mean \nsea level altitude relative to the Earth’s geoid so as to relate it to the geophysical \nparameters of temperature, pressure and water vapor partial pressure in the geoid \nframe. \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n71\n6.3 Algorithm Functional Specifications \n6.3.1 Retrieval of temperature (T), pressure (P) and water vapor        partial \npressure (e) from refractivity: Theoretical background \nThe refractivity, N, is related to temperature (T), pressure (P) and water vapor \npartial pressure (e) via (Gorbunov et al., 1996; Ware et al., 1996; Rocken et al., \n1997; Kursinski et al., 1997; Steiner et al., 1999) \ni\ni\nw\nw\ne\nW\na\nW\na\nf\nO\nf\nn\nT\ne\na\nT\nP\na\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n1\n(\n10\n3.\n40\n2\n1\n3\n2\n6\n2\n                         \n                                                                                                                         (7) \nwith a1=77.6 K/mbar; a2=3.73x105 K2/mbar; P – the total pressure; T – \ntemperature; e – water vapor partial pressure; ne – electron number density (m-\n3); f – operating frequency (Hz); Ww and Wi  being liquid water and ice content \nrespectively in grams per cubic meter, aw and ai are 1.4 and 0.6 (cubic \nmeter/grams) respectively. The first (second) term in equation (7) is usually \nknown as hydrostatic (or, dry) term (wet term).  \nFor realistic suspensions of water and ice, the last two terms of (7) are small in \ncomparison with other terms and are neglected for practical purposes (Hajj et al. \n2002). When the signal is passing through the ionosphere the first two terms of \n(7) can be ignored, as well as higher order ionospheric terms. Therefore, \nmeasurement of n directly corresponds to electron density in the ionosphere. \nIn the neutral atmosphere (tangent point height < 60 km), the ionospheric \ncalibration process effectively removes the first order ionosphere term (1/f2) in \n(7). In order to solve for P, T and/or e, given N, one has to use additional \nconstraints of hydrostatic equilibrium and the ideal gas law: \n\ng\ndh\ndP\n\n\n                                                                                             (8) \nTR\ne\nm\nm\nTR\nP\nm\nd\nw\nd\nw\nd\n)\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        (9) \nWhere, h is height; g is the acceleration due to gravity;  \n, d, w total, dry air \nand water vapor densities respectively; md, mw the mean molecular mass of dry \nair (28.97 g/mole) and water vapor (18.0 g/mole), respectively; R is the \nuniversal gas constant.  \nCombining (8) and (9) and, using (7) (ignoring ionospheric, ice and liquid water \nterms) to substitute for P/T, we obtain \nT\ne\nR\nm\nm\ng\nT\ne\nR\na\ngm\na\nN\nR\na\ngm\ndh\ndP\nw\nd\nd\nd\n)\n(\n1\n2\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n                          (10) \nGiven N, we have a system of two equations ((7) and (10)) and three unknowns \n(T, P, and e). Since saturation vapor pressure decreases rapidly with decreasing \ntemperature, e can be ignored above the tropospheric height corresponding to \n230 K; therefore given N, both T and P can be solved for in the upper \ntroposphere and stratosphere from (7) and (10) and a boundary condition \n(usually taken to be a temperature boundary condition at ~60 km estimated from \na climatology or an atmospheric model). What we get are the “dry” temperature \nand pressure, accurate to real temperature and pressure in the water vapor scarce \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n72\nregion obtained in the upper troposphere and beyond. The “dry” T has a cold \nbias in the lower troposphere below 230K as shown in figure 3.  \n                      \n \nFigure 3. A depiction of cold bias in “dry” temperature below 10km  \nRealistic temperature and pressure profile require inclusion of water vapor \npressure (e) term in equation (7) and (10) for retrieval below 230K. This \ndemarcation at  \n230K temperature is defined as the water vapor point (O’ Sullivan et al. 2000). \nThe water vapor point is observed to vary in different latitude zones. For the \ntropics (30S-30N), the water vapor point at 230K is determined through  a \nsensitivity study of the error statistics of retrieved T, P and e from refractivity, N \nto different choices of water vapor point (Shyam et al., 2009). In altitude terms, \nthe water vapor point for the tropics range from 10-12km. Below this altitude, \nwater vapor has a non-negligible concentration and contributes significantly to \nrefractivity. Thus, the algorithm goes for a composite retrieval (to be called “Wet \nretrieval”) of all the three unknowns simultaneously.  \n“Wet” Retrieval   \nThe algorithm approximates temperature, for the region below the “water vapor \npoint (wvp)”, to be a quadratic function of the natural logarithm of atmospheric \npressure.  Between the estimated water vapor point and the surface (or, the lowest \naltitude at which a’ priori P and T are available), temperature is assumed to vary \nas a quadratic function of natural logarithm of P (denoted by σ) i.e. T (σ) = a + \nb*σ + c*σ2. We have T and σ at water vapor point, where the dry temperature and \npressure are approximated as actual temperature and pressure and the surface \n(known from meteorological observations or reanalysis of Numerical weather \nprediction models like ECMWF or NCEP), giving two equations for the \ntemperature quadratic i.e., \n \n2\n)\n(\ns\ns\ns\nc\nb\na\nT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n                         \n \n(11) \n Where \ns\n is the natural logarithm of surface pressure. \n  \n2\n)\n(\nwv\nwv\nwv\nc\nb\na\nT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n                           \n \n(12) \nWhere \nwv\n\nis the natural logarithm of pressure at the water vapor point. \nA third equation is written using hydrostatic approximation as given under                                       \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n73\n   \ndz\nR\ng\nd\nT\nw\nw\nz\nz\nair\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n)\n(\n                          \n \n(13)   \nThe right hand side of (13) is evaluated by approximating the gas constant for air \n(Rair), as that of dry air (Rdry), as we do not have any knowledge of water vapor in \nthe beginning. Solving equations (11) to (13), one obtains the three coefficients \nfor the temperature quadratic. Once a first estimate of temperature quadratic is \nmade, temperature profile in the first iteration is evaluated using dry pressure and \nwater vapor pressure is calculated using the equation  \n    \n5\n2\n10\n73\n.\n3\n6\n.\n77\n\n\n\nPT\nN\nT\ne\n                                     \n \n (14) \nOnce a first estimate of e is made water vapor mixing ratio (w) is calculated using \nthe formula  \n   \nP\ne\nw\n\n\n622\n.\n0\n                                                \n \n (15)                              \nThereafter, the virtual temperature (Tv) profile is calculated using the formula \n   \n)\n0\n.\n1\n(\n))\n*\n61\n.\n1\n(\n0\n.\n1\n(\nw\nw\nT\nTv\n\n\n\n                               \n \n(16) \nOnce a virtual temperature profile is estimated, the pressure profile is re-estimated \nusing the hydrostatic equation \n  \n)\nexp(\ndz\nT\nR\ng\nP\nP\nz\nz\ndry\nw\nw\n\n\n                         \n \n(17) \nWhere, Pw is pressure at the water vapor point zw. \n \n Re-estimated pressure is then used to calculate temperature, water vapor (and \nvirtual temperature) profiles in successive iterations until the three profiles \nconverge. It is worth noting that two options are possible here (not pointed out by \nO’Sullivan et al. (2000)): (i) keep the coefficients of temperature quadratic same \nthroughout the iterations with R=Rdry approximation in equation (13), and (ii) \nupdate the right hand side integral in equation (13) with water vapor information \nand hence solve for fresh temperature quadratic coefficients in each iteration \nwhich requires refractivity profile available up to the surface or lower altitude. \nCurrently, only the first option is considered as the radio occultation derived \nrefractivity profiles do not reach the surface and are often available only up to \naltitudes of 1 km and above only. Also, knowledge of near-surface refractivity \nrequires information on surface specific humidity and hence in practice the second \noption is not feasible. \n6.4 Operational Implementation  \nFor ease of operational implementation, the algorithm will be formalized into a \nsoftware to be designed and developed in a modular fashion. Different functions \nof the algorithm, as compositely shown in the flowchart in the following sub-\nsection, will be divided into five sub-modules, the first four sub-modules \nperforming specific pre-processing of the principal input (i.e. Level-1 refractivity \nprofile) as well as the auxiliary data, dry computation and water vapor point \nMegha-Tropiques ATBD Ver 3.0 \n74\nlocation before feeding into the fifth module for “wet retrieval”.

The exact location over which \nradio occultation measurements are possible, require prior knowledge of \nGPS and Megha-Tropiques orbit. One may expect 500 to 800 occultations \nper day spread in the domain (30S-30N; 180W-180E) with dense \noccurrence around 10-20S/N. \n Theoretically, the GPS-RO data of reliable quality may range from 0 – \n60km in the neutral atmosphere. Practically, the measurements are reliable \nbetween altitudes of 5 to 30 km height, irrespective of the atmospheric \ndynamics. Since, ROSA coverage will be confined to the tropics where \nmoisture gradients creates multipath conditions, advanced techniques to \nretrieve refractivity profile by an open-loop processing as implemented in \nglobal missions like COSMIC, GRAS etc., may be required to penetrate to \nnear surface altitudes ~ 0.1 km or less. Examination of COSMIC profiles \nover the ocean indicates that more than 90% of the radio occultation \nrefractivity measurements are available up to an altitude of 0.5 km from \nthe mean sea level. \n The algorithm uses the CIRA-86 COSPAR upper-air atmospheric model \ndata of zonal mean temperature and pressure available up to 120km for the \ncomputation of hydrostatic integral. The accuracy of the upper-air data as \nquoted by COSPAR has been assumed suo motu, in the absence of ways to \nvalidate them. \n The monthly mean surface temperature, pressure and altitude data are \ngenerated from NCEP analyses at global grid of 1deg x1 deg resolution as \nfirst guess estimates. The standard deviations (all months and for 30S-\n30N) of mean surface temperature and mean surface pressure are ~ 1K and \n0.05-2.0hPa respectively. To get a more accurate first guess, the use of \ndaily forecast of NCEP, nearest to ROSA occultation event time and \nlocation is imperative.  \n6.7 References: \n1. Ao, C.O., T. K. Meehan, G.A.

For operational generation of AWV products, L2B data \n(with 25 km resolution) of ASCAT provided by EUMETSAT’s broadcast system for environmental data \n(EUMETCAST) are being used. \nIn order to construct global synoptic wind fields from the along track wind observations (e.g. wind vector \nand wind stress), spatial interpolation of the missing data grids is performed. In our study, we have used  \ninterpolation algorithm based on simple eight grid averaging technique, known as box averaging \ninterpolation. If the growth of wind field over oceans is assumed to be stochastic, the predicted value for a \nmissing grid can be fairly specified by the average of surrounding eight grids with equal weights. This \nmethod is comparatively fast and can be used operationally for all regions and all seasons. \nThis box averaging technique is physically applicable only on the scalar spatial functions. Hence, first of all, \nwe have prepared gridded data for each of the two (zonal and meridional) components of the wind vectors \nand wind stress. Then the missing grids over global oceans are filled up using the above averaging \ntechnique. This method iteratively fills up all the missing data grids on global scale. If the number of \niterations increases after an optimal value, the accuracy in the resultant product decreases. Being a very \nsimple iterative interpolation technique, box-averaging method fills up all the missing data grids on NRT \nbasis. The method is tested for high gradient of wind fields (e.g. tropical cyclones) and found to produce \nsatisfactory results.   \nThe gridded wind fields are computed in near real time with a delay of 24 hours for daily winds and 12hours \nfor 12hourly winds. Every product also contains a log file for the quality of analysed wind products. \nSometimes, swath data are not available due to unforeseen circumstances, even then analysed fields are \ngenerated which contains wider gaps or larger spatial interpolation. In such cases, analysed winds may not \nbe of good quality and it is mentioned in the Log file. This version is a  test dataset to  provide  insight for \nnear real time generation of high spatial and  temporal resolutions at later stage. The data are available at \nMOSDAC \n(http://www.mosdac.gov.in/) \nand \ncan \nbe \nfreely \ndistributed \n(Contact \npersons: \nrksharma@sac.isro.gov.in and abhisek1984@sac.isro.gov.in ). The data files are in BINARY (GrADS) \nformat.   \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe ASCAT level2B data used for these products are made available by EUMETSAT through \nEUMETCAST.

The Level-2B products are being disseminated through NRSC web-\nsite (www.nrsc.gov.in). \n \nHigher spatial-density (~15 km) vector winds are being generated using the operational Level-2A \nand Level-2B data by exploiting the high density backscatter data available within Level-2A and the \nOSCAT specific Geophysical Model Functions (GMF).   \n \nThe approach used for the purpose is that firstly the wind directions at finer spatial spacing are \nobtained through vector interpolation of 50 km (L2B) considering the central and the neighboring grids \nthen the associated wind speeds are obtained using GMF and the interpolated wind directions.

The ATBD \ncontains three major algorithms for derivation of wind vector solutions, directional \nambiguity removal and rain flagging. It also describes two crucial aspects specific to \nOceansat-2, firstly, the development of Geophysical Model Functions (GMF) needed for \nwind vector retrieval and secondly, the development of rain impact model necessary for \nrain flagging. In order to realize retrieval as well as flagging, requirements of different \ntypes of global data sets are also specified along with its utilization procedures. \nFor deriving wind vector solutions, a new and efficient algorithm has been \ndeveloped which is as good as Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) algorithm being \nused operationally for the earlier and ongoing global scatterometer missions. The \nalgorithm developed for directional ambiguity removal is based on median filter and it \noperates in two stages considering observational data at different spatial coverage in order \nto tackle the localized ambiguities also. The rain flagging algorithm makes use of the cost \nfunction developed for wind solution extraction which gets modified under rain free and \nrainy situations. The sea-ice flagging approach is adopted from the literature which is \nused for sea-ice detection from Quikscat data. The present ATBD describes the \nprocedures for developing GMF specific to Oceansat-2 scatterometer by using \nsimultaneous observations of radar backscatter from Oceansat-2 and reanalysis wind \nvector fields from AGCM (atmospheric general circulation model - ECMWF)  for rain \nfree conditions using rain information from TRMM or DMSP-SSM/I. Like-wise, \nprocedures for rain impact model development are also described in ATBD based on \natmospheric attenuation and rain fall to be available from TRMM-PR along with \nOceansat-2 scatterometer radar backscatter and model analysis wind data.  \nAnalysis of limited data of Quikscat scatterometer, sensitivity studies related to \nwind vector retrieval using both the algorithms (MLE and in-house), rain and sea ice \nflagging, assumptions made in algorithms and various procedures, and overall limitations \nof retrievals are also presented. \n \n  \n \n1\n1.0 Introduction: \n \n  \nThe ocean surface wind is the main driving force for ocean circulation and for \ngeneration of surface waves and currents. It plays an important role in air-sea interaction, \nupwelling, biogeochemical transport in the ocean and several other processes.  The ocean \nsurface wind vector is an essential input parameter for prediction models of ocean \ncirculation and waves, which are used for oceanographic applications and climate related \nstudies.  It is also an indispensable parameter along with a few others, for the prediction \nof storm surges caused by storms formed in the oceans, which hit the coasts causing \ndisaster in the coastal regions. Besides meteorological applications, ocean surface wind \nprovides forcing parameters for studying the ocean general circulation. Scatterometer data \ncan also be useful for ocean wave mapping and wave forecasting, offshore activities, ship \nrouting, fisheries etc.  Besides, wind vectors from scatterometer, when properly \nassimilated in an appropriate numerical model, helps improving weather forecast. \nRepetitive measurements of surface wind field over global oceans are thus necessary for \nthe above studies and applications. \nWind vectors are usually obtained from microwave scatterometers operating at \nmicrowave frequencies in 5-14 GHz range.  This part of the spectrum is useful for \nmeasurements under all weather conditions except heavy precipitation.  However, the \nwind speeds can also be obtained from space-borne microwave radiometers and \naltimeters. Moreover, the upcoming microwave polarimetry is being considered for vector \nwind measurements. \n \n2.0 Scatterometer measurements: \n \nActive microwave remote sensing of ocean surface winds has started since the \nlaunch of SEASAT in 1978.  This was the first satellite dedicated to the ocean research \nand was an experimental satellite, which demonstrated the retrieval of wind to an \naccuracy of 2 m/s, from wide swath scatterometer. ERS-1 & 2 satellites were launched \nwith C-band microwave scatterometers. Japanese satellite ADEOS-1 carried a Ku-band \nscatterometer. Pencil-beam scatterometers operating at Ku-band were launched onboard \nADEOS-2 and Quikscat satellites. Quikscat scatterometer is currently in orbit. A similar \npencil-beam scatterometer operating at Ku band is due for launch onboard Indian satellite \nOceansat-2 satellite. \n  \n \n2\nScatterometer is an active microwave instrument (radar), which measures the \nmicrowave energy backscattered from an area over the earth’s surface illuminated by it. \nFrom the known transmitted and backscattered energy along with measurement geometry \nand other sensor related parameters, the radar backscatter coefficient or the normalized \nradar cross section (NRCS) symbolized as σ0 (sigma naught) is derived. The σ0 \nmeasurements over the ocean are used for wind vector determination. The philosophy of \nwind retrieval is discussed later, however, multiple measurements of backscatter are \nrequired for this purpose and scatterometers are designed to realize the same with \nmultiple beams (antennae) in configurations like fan-beam or pencil-beam. \nThe fan-beam type employs two or more single or dual polarization antennae and \nhas maximum azimuth separation of 90 degrees like those launched onboard Seasat, ERS-\n1/2 and ADEOS-1 satellites. The pencil beam type scatterometers observe radar \nbackscatter at different azimuth separation angles like those launched onboard ADEOS-2 \nand Quikscat satellites. Retrieval of the surface wind vector in terms of speed and \ndirection takes place using these so called 'triplets', 'quadruplets' or multiple of radar \nbackscatter through a model known as Geophysical Model Function (GMF) which relates \npolarized backscatter with wind speed, wind direction and observational geometry. \n \n3.0 Oceansat-2 scatterometer system: \n \nOceansat-2 satellite in sun-synchronous orbit at 720 km altitude will carry a Ku-\nband microwave scatterometer (SCAT) and an Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM). The \nsatellite will have two days repeat cycle with equator descending time around noon.  \nThe scatterometer system has a 1-m parabolic dish antenna and a dual feed \nassembly to generate the two beams and is scanned at a rate of 20.5 rpm to cover the \nentire swath. The inner beam makes an incidence angle of ~ 49° and the outer beam \nmakes an incidence angle of ~ 57° on the ground. It covers a continuous swath of 1400 \nKm for inner beam and 1840 Km for outer beam respectively. The inner beam is \nconfigured in horizontal polarization and the outer beam is configured to vertical \npolarization for both transmit and receive modes. The horizontal polarization is chosen \nfor inner beam in order to alleviate the low backscatter value problem of horizontal \npolarization at lower wind speeds. This would ensure the reduction in the path loss due to \nthe slant range and hence maintains an almost the same SNR for both the inner and outer \n  \n \n3\nbeams. Brief specifications of the scatterometer view geometry are provided in Table (1). \nFigure (1a) shows the viewing geometry of the scatterometer (SAC, 2005). \n \nTable 1: Technical characteristics of Oceansat-2 Scatterometer \n \n \nFigure 1a: Viewing geometry of Oceansat-2 Scatterometer \n \n3.1 Oceansat-2 scatterometer data swath: \n \nVarious types of the wind vector cells available from a pencil-beam scatterometer \nare depicted in figure (1b). Due to circular scanning of two beams at fixed incidence \nangles, areas of a particular size cut across the swath contain variable number of \nbackscatter measurements impacting the wind retrieval.

Over sweet zone, measurements available from both the beams with \ndual look directions also having good optimal azimuth diversity are very much suitable \nfor better wind vector retrieval. Over nadir zone, measurements available from both the \nbeams with dual look directions but with non-optimal azimuth diversity lead to more \nerroneous wind vectors. Wind direction ambiguity removal processes for outer and nadir \nzones are different and require special efforts mentioned briefly later. \n  \n3.2 Geophysical products specifications: \nGiven below are specifications as per the existing satellite mission, however, \nbased on Oceansat-2 design, post-launch performance and GMF characteristics, these \nspecifications may slightly deviate. \n \n Table 2: Geophysical product requirements: \nGeophysical Parameter\n*Range \n*Accuracy (rms) \nWind Speed \n3 – 20 m/s \n20 – 30 m/s \n2 m/s \n10 % \nWind Direction \n0 – 360 Deg.\n20 \n*At 25 km wind vector cell (NASA, 2006),  \nMinor deviation anticipated for Oceansat-2 \n  \n \n5\n \n3.3 Oceansat-2 scatterometer data processing flow: \n \nFigure (2) depicts the process flow from Level 2A scatterometer data product to \nthe Level 2B wind vector data product including flags.

The wind forcing generates a spectrum of surface \nwaves in which growth of capillary waves is directly influenced by wind intensity.  The \nbasic mechanism at work is the Bragg Resonance, in which the waves satisfying Bragg’s \ncondition produce strong radar backscatter energy.  The backscatter signal also depends \nupon the incidence angle of radar beam.  The directional anisotropy of the radar signal, \ncaused by the azimuth symmetry of sea surface roughness, yields multiple solutions of \nderived wind vectors (especially direction). Among these, only one solution is “true” and \nremaining solutions are known as directional “ambiguities”.  Multi-beam scatterometer is \nused to overcome this problem of ambiguities to a certain extent. The radar backscatter \nshows a harmonic nature as expressed by (Ulaby et al, 1981, Wentz and Smith, 1999 and \nothers)  \n  \n \n6\n \n0(W, ϕ, p, θ) =  Σ\nNh \ni=0Bi.cos (i.ϕ)           with     Bi=  Pi(p,θ).WQ\ni\n(p,θ) \n1 \n \nwhere,  ϕ is relative wind direction (ϕ = χ- φ), an angle between radar azimuth φ and \nwind direction χ both measured in meteorological convention (clockwise from local \nNorth direction with a zero degree wind direction representing a wind blowing from \nNorth to the point of observation). Here, the ocean surface wind speed W is at neutral \nstability height of 10 m. The coefficients Bi are harmonic components with Pi and Qi \ncoefficients expressed as functions of polarization p and LQFLGHQFH\u0003 DQJOH\u0003 \u0003 DW\u0003 D\u0003 JLYHQ\u0003\nradar operating frequency and Nh is the number of harmonics considered. As, so far, the \nobserved dependency of radar backscatter on wind conditions has not been well-\nexplained theoretically, the empirical relationships are established using simultaneous \nmeasurements of radar backscatter and ocean surface wind vector obtained through model \nanalysis as well as insitu measurements. The Geophysical Model Function (GMF) is an \nempirical relationship between radar backscatter and wind vector.  \nIn equation (1), the non harmonic component (or the constant term) signifies the \nbase value of variation of radar backscatter for a given wind speed, incidence angle and \npolarization, the first harmonic represents the upwind-downwind ratio of backscatter \nwhile second harmonic which is dominant among all other harmonics signifies the \nupwind-crosswind ratio. Though the third harmonic representing the skewness around \ncross wind direction is very small in value but along with the first harmonic, it is very \nimportant for the wind direction retrieval. \n \n4.1 Prevailing GMF: \n \nThere are various GMFs available for Ku-band known as SASS-1, SASS-2, \nNSCAT-1, NSCAT-2, and QSCAT-1. The functional forms of these GMFs are given by \nSchroeder et al, (1982); Wentz, (1994); Wentz and Smith (1999) and Dunbar (1999). As \nan example of the difference among GMFs, the variation of horizontal polarization radar \nbackscatter from NSCAT-1 and QSCAT-1 GMFs at different wind speeds is depicted in \nfigure (3). \n \n  \n \n7\n(a)\n \n0\n30\n60\n90\n120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 360\nRelative wind direction (degree)\n-45\n-40\n-35\n-30\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\nSigma-0 (dB) \nWS=2 m/s\nWS=8 m/s\nWS=14 m/s\nWS=20 m/s\n   (b) \n0\n30\n60\n90\n120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 360\nRelative wind direction (degree)\n-45\n-40\n-35\n-30\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\nSigma-0 (dB) \nWS=2 m/s\nWS=8 m/s\nWS=14 m/s\nWS=20 m/s\n \nFigure 3: Variation of horizontally polarized σ0 with relative wind direction at incidence \nangle of 46 degree using different GMFs, (a) NSCAT-1, (b) QSCAT-1 \n \nIt is important to note that these GMFs are system specific and vary from system \nto system. Hence, these GMFs are required to be redeveloped or refined for an \nindependently designed scatterometer system. \n \n4.2 GMF development procedures: \n \nAfter normalization with the constant term, the equation (1), considering \nvariations in radar backscatter up to third harmonic of wind direction, is rewritten as  \n \n0 = A0[1+A1.cos (ϕ)+ A2.cos (2ϕ)+ A3.cos (3ϕ)] \n1a \n \nwhere, the coefficients Ai are functions of wind speed, incidence angle and polarization. \nIn order to determine the coefficient A0 at desired incidence angle, wind speed and \npolarization, the σ0 values for all relative wind direction ϕ varying from 0 to 2π are \naveraged yielding A0 coefficient as the summation of Cos(ϕ), Cos(2ϕ) and Cos(3ϕ) \nvanishes \nA0 = <σ0> \n2 \n \nDividing equation (1a) by A0 on both sides and rearranging the terms we get \n \n  \n \n8\nY = A1 Cos(ϕ) + A2 Cos(2ϕ)+ A3 Cos(3ϕ)          where Y = (σ0/A0)–1 \n3 \n \n  \nAt desired incidence angle, polarization and wind speed, by determining Y at each \nϕ value, the harmonic coefficients Ai are established through statistical analysis.  This \nprocedure yields the GMF coefficients as well as an idea about the scatterometer data \nquality. \nIt is important that for each bin of wind speed the wind direction corresponding to \nradar backscatter should have uniform distribution with statistical significance while for \nany bin of relative wind direction the wind speed should have Rayleigh distribution \n(Wentz et al, 1984). Thus, it requires a large database of simultaneous backscatter and \nwind vector measurements in order to meet this requirement for GMF development. \nMoreover, the data should also be for rain free situations requiring simultaneous \nobservations of rain. \nAs a prelude to GMF development, analysis of Quikscat data (MGDR NRT \nVersion in BUFR format at 25 km spatial resolution) for orbit #29820 on March 11, 2005 \nat 12.00 GMT is performed. Figure (4) shows the scatter plot of Quikscat radar \nbackscatter with relative wind direction obtained making use of NCEP model winds \nprovided along with the data. \n \n(a)\n (b)\n \n  \n \n9\n(c)\n (d)\n \n \nFigure 4: Distribution of horizontal and vertical polarization radar backscatter with \nrelative direction for one orbit of Quikcat scatterometer for various wind speed \nbins at, (a) 4-6 m/s, (b) 10-11 m/s, (c) 17-18 m/s and (d) 19-20 m/s. \n \nThe A0 coefficients for selected wind speed values are derived from the above \nQuikscat data as depicted in figure (5). A comparison of derived A0 from the data set and \nfrom the Quikscat GMF QSCAT-1 is also depicted. The observed difference between \nGMF and data derived A0 coefficient is quite evident due to incompleteness of the \nobservation set. \n \n \nFigure 5: Comparison of A0 coefficients derived from Quikscat data and the QSCAT-1 \nGMF. \n \n  \n \n10\nDue to the non-availability of large data sets of radar backscatter, the above \nexercise with radar backscatter simulated using NSCAT-1 and QSCAT-1 GMFs has been \nperformed for wind speed only up to 20 m/s which is the specified range for NSCAT-1. \nThe comparison of harmonic coefficients (proxy GMF) established using these two \nGMFs has been performed (Tiwari and Gohil, 2005) as shown in figure (6). The \ndifference in two GMFs in terms of harmonic coefficients is quite evident. Moreover, the \nNSCAT-1 and QSCAT-1 GMFs were developed considering two and three harmonics, \nrespectively. The comparison reveals the fact that the GMFs are sensor specific. \n  \n(a)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\nWind speed (m/s)\n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\nA0H (dB) at 46 deg for H-pol\nNSCAT-1\nQSCAT-1\n (b)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\nWind speed (m/s)\n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\nA0V (dB) at 54 deg for V-pol\nNSCAT-1\nQSCAT-1\n \n \n(c)\n     (d)\n \n \n  \n \n11\n(e)\n       (f)\n \n \n(g)\n    (h)\n \n \nFigure 6: Comparison of harmonic coefficients established using NSCAT-1 and QSCAT-\n1 GMFs \n \n4.2.1 Post-launch ancillary data requirements for GMF development: \n \nThe basic data sets needed are the global observations of radar backscatter from \nOceansat-2 scatterometer and near concurrent model analysis wind vector data. In order \nto develop GMF for rain free conditions, near concurrent observations of rain is also \nrequired from other satellites like TRMM-PR/TMI and DMSP-SSM-I. The collection of \nthese data sets is planned for about six months from the launch of Oceansat-2 satellite. \nThe justification for six month period is that a sufficient data base is required to be \nprepared to cover the widest range of wind speed as well as the entire range of wind \ndirection for all wind speed preferably the low and high speed ranges also pertaining to \nrain free situations. The data required for GMF development is reflected in Table (3). \n  \n \n12\n \n \nTable 3: Ancillary data for Oceansat-2 scatterometer GMF development: \nSource \nSensor \nParameter \nOceansat-2/ Scatterometer \nBackscatter & ancil. data \nSatellite \nTRMM-PR/TMI and SSM-I \nRain rate \nGlobal \nModels \nECMWF/ NCEP/ NCMRWF \nModel analysis \nWind speed and dir, \nSST, surface air temp. \nand humidity \nInsitu \nNIOT/ NIO/ -ICOADS /TRITON \nbuoys, AWS and ship cruise data \nWind speed and dir \n \n \n5.0 Wind vector retrieval and the state of art: \n \nThe radar backscatter having harmonic dependence on wind direction yields \nmultiple solutions of wind vector from a given set of radar backscatter measurements. As \nthe radar backscatter is a function of wind speed and direction, two measurements of \nradar backscatter are essentially required to determine wind vector. However, unique \nsolutions are not possible due to the harmonic nature of backscatter on wind direction and \nthe presence of noise in radar data. Among these multiple wind vector solutions, only one \nsolution corresponds to true wind vector while others are ambiguities also known as \n“ aliases”. Although, the wind speed solutions are very close to each other, the direction \nsolutions are quite apart. The solutions are prioritized (or ranked) based on certain \ncriterion used in algorithm. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated in terms of \npercentage of highest priority (rank-1) solutions correctly identifying the true directions \nout of the total number of data cases processed. \nUnder noise-free conditions, the rank-1 solution always represents the true wind \nvector but for noisy or real data, it is always not so.  However, the first two highest \nranked solutions contain the true direction most of the times.  The selection of vector \nsolution nearest to the true wind vector is performed through the directional ambiguity \nremoval algorithm. An overall scheme for retrieval of wind vector field is depicted in \nfigure (7). \n  \n \n13\n \nWIND VECTOR SOLUTIONS \nRETRIEVAL ALGORITHM\nGEOPHYSICAL \nMODEL \nFUNCTIONS\nDIRECTIONAL AMBIGUITY \nREMOVAL ALGORITHM\nFILTERED WIND \nVECTOR FIELD\nLOCALIZED AMBIGUITY \nREMOVAL ALGORITHM\nRAIN \nIMPACT \nMODEL\nRAIN FLAGGING ALGORITHM \nPRIORITIZED WIND \nVECTOR SOLNS \n(RAIN-FREE)\nFINAL WIND \nVECTOR FIELD\nOCEANIC RADAR \nBACKSCATTER \nDATA\n \nFigure 7: An overall scheme for retrieval of wind vector field \n \n5.1 Algorithm for retrieval of wind vector solutions: \n \nThe maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) algorithm developed based on \nBayesian approach is the best algorithm (Chi and Li, 1988), which is widely and \noperationally used for the scatterometer missions launched so far. More so, variants of \nMLE algorithm have also been developed (Stoffelen and Anderson, 1997; Stoffelen and \nPortabella, 2006) with difference in its implementation. In some of the variants of MLE, a \ntransformed MLE has also been developed. The algorithm developed recently is based on \ntransformed MLE, which is as good as MLE but is computationally efficient. This \nrecently developed algorithm is described here. The cost function used in MLE algorithm \n(Pierson, 1989), is given as \n \nMLCF(Wk, χk) = Σ\nM \ni=1{(σ0M(φi, θi, pi) - σ0G(Wj, ϕki, θi, pi)) / Kpij.σ0G(Wj, ϕki, θi, pi)}2\n4 \n \nWhere, σ0M is backscatter measured by ith scatterometer antenna beam at incidence angle \nθi, polarization pi with azimuth direction φi, σ0G is backscatter calculated from GMF for a \ntrial wind speed Wj and trial kth wind direction χk, ϕki is relative wind direction taken as \nϕki = χk- φi and φi is antenna azimuth direction from North direction. \nFor an assumed wind direction, the cost function MLCF is minimized by using \nsimulated backscatter for varying wind speed Wj with a suitable increment and the \n  \n \n14\nnonlinear interpolation. The minimum of MLCF is dependent on the wind speed search \ninterval.  As smallest is the interval (more computations) precise is the minimum. This \nprocess can also be realized using individual minimization for which the MLCF is \ntransformed from backscatter space to the wind speed space and is referred here as \nnormalized variance (NV) given by \n \nNVk = Σ\nM \ni=1{(Wki  - Wk) / Kpi Wk}2 \n5 \n \nWhere Wki is a wind speed derived from ith measurement σ0M(φi, θi, pi) while Wk is a best \n(but with errors) wind speed to which all measurements are associated with.  \n \nIn this recent approach, a given backscatter observation σ0M(φi, θi, pi) is converted \ninto wind speed Wki for an assumed wind direction through GMF as \n \nWki = Wj   such that  σ0M(φi, θi, pi) = σ0G(Wj, ϕki, θi, pi) \n6 \n \n \nHere, Wj is varied over the range specified by GMF being used and Wki is obtained \nnumerically through linear interpolation of σ0G and Wj (due to its closure form and hence \nefficient). \nThe derived wind speed Wki is a sum of true speed WTk and an error WEki which is \na manifestation of errors in backscatter. The true error in σ0M is unknown but is \nrepresented by variance of σ0M (communication noise) defined in terms of Kp value \nwhich can be calculated using model backscatter (GMF) and the sensor parameters α, β \nand γ (Fischer, 1972; Long and Mendel, 1991; Oliphant and Long, 1999) as \n \nKpi = √((γi / σ0G\ni \n2) + (βi / σ0G\ni) +α i } \n7 \n \nThus assuming WEki = Kpi.WTk, the Wki can be redefined considering the \nbackscatter variance as \n \nWki = WTk(1+ Kpi) \n8 \n  \n \n15\n \nUsing M number of σ0M measurements, the backscatter variance-weighted mean \nof derived wind speed for trial wind direction χK is defined as \n \nWk = Σ\nM \ni=1{Wki /(1+Kpi)} / Σ\nM \ni=1{1 /(1+Kpi)} \n9 \n \nSince Wki is calculated assuming σ0G\n = σ0M, the Kpi value cannot be calculated \nfrom σ0M. For this reason, all Kpi values are first initialized to zero, and then Wki and \ncorresponding Kpi are calculated through GMF using equations (4) and (2), respectively. \nThe Wk is recalculated using the updated values of Kpi, and the procedure is repeated till \nWk is converged yielding final Kpi and Wk.  \nSince Kp value is already used in Wk, ignoring Kp in equation (5) yields NV as  \n \nNVk = Σ\nM \ni=1{(Wki  - Wk) / Wk}2 \n10 \n \nThe above term can also be expressed as normalized standard deviation (NSD) \nand standard deviation (SD) of wind speed derived from backscatter measurements as \ngiven below \n \nNSDk = (1/Wk)√[(1/M) Σ\nM \ni=1(Wki  - Wk)2] \n11 \n \nSDk = √[(1/M) Σ\nM \ni=1(Wki  - Wk)2] \n12 \n \nThe present algorithm referred as NSDA makes use of parameter NSD for \nderiving as well as for ranking the wind vector solutions. As NSD or SD are obtained \nfrom Wki values which are derivable due to their closure form for a given trial direction, \nthis approach becomes very efficient (Chi and Li, 1988). Based on SD without \nconsidering the measurement variance, an algorithm developed in-house was used for \n  \n \n16\nSEASAT-A and ERS-1 scatterometers (Gohil and Pandey, 1985; Gohil, 1992; Gohil and \nPandey, 1995). Retrieval algorithm using NSD ignoring Kp value was developed and \ntested with Quikscat data (Gohil et al, 2006). In the present study, NSD considering the \nKp value is used for ranking the solutions. The parameter SD is used for rain flagging \ndiscussed later.

For χ=0°, calculate wind speed WS1i using equation (6) \nfor the “ ith” backscatter measurement by varying wind speed over full GMF range with \ninterval δWS1 (1.0 m/s). Using all WS1i, also find the weighted mean Wm and the \nnormalized standard deviation NSD values from equations (9) and (11), respectively,  \n2) Truncating WS1i with 1.0 m/s precision denoted by WStrnci, evaluate wind \nspeed regimes ∆WS1i separately for all the beams using the following equation  \n \n∆WS1i = WStrnci ± δWS1.δχ \n13 \n \n  \n \n17\n3) Repeat steps (1 and 2) using ∆WS1i for the remaining trial directions \n4) Find vector solutions by searching minima of NSD along χ yielding NS \nsolutions with Wn\nm wind speed and χn direction and the corresponding NSDn values \n5) Find precision direction solution χn\nprcn through calculating minimum of \nquadratic fit of NSDn values obtained for χ varied between χn±δχ with 1° trial direction \ninterval starting with wind speed search regime ∆WS1i at χn-δχ trial direction \n6) At precision direction solutions χn\nprcn, find Wn\nm and NSDn through step 2 \nexploiting ∆WS1i values at χn-δχ trial direction. The derived precision solutions of wind \nspeed, direction and corresponding NSD are denoted by Wn\nmprcn, χn\nprcn and NSDn\nprcn, \nrespectively \n7) Rank the wind vector solutions on the basis of NSD values. The wind vector \nsolution having minimum NSD is ranked as rank-1 solution and so on. \n \nFor comparison purpose, the MLE algorithm is also implemented in following \nsteps: \n1) First, assume a trial wind direction interval of 2°, denoted by δχ. For χ=0°, find \nwind speed denoted by WS1 corresponding to minimum MLCF determined as per \nequation (4) using wind speed varied over full GMF range with 1.0 m/s interval denoted \nby δWS1. \n2) Evaluate wind speed regime ∆WS1 from WS1 using the following equation.  \n \n∆WS1 = WS1 ± 2δWS1. δχ \n14 \n \n3) Find wind speed denoted by WS2 through searching MLCF minimum using \nwind speed regime ∆WS1with 0.2 m/s wind speed interval termed as δWS2. \n4) Find precision wind speed WS2prcn through minimum of quadratic fit of MLCF \naround WS2 with winds between WS2 ± δWS2 and recalculate MLCF2prcn for WS2prcn at \nχ=0°. \n5) Truncate WS2prcn with 0.2 m/s precision denoted by WStrnc and find the wind \nspeed regime for the next trial direction χ is given as \n \n∆WS2 = WStrnc ± 2δWS2. δχ \n15 \n  \n \n18\n \n6) Repeat steps (3 through 5) for the remaining trial directions varied with an \ninterval δχ with wind corresponding to wind speed regimes given by equation (14). \n7) Find vector solutions by searching minima of MLCF2prcn along trial direction. \nDenote number of solutions as NS and their serial numbers as n. The solutions of wind \nspeed, direction and the corresponding MLCF thus obtained are denoted by WSn, χn and \nMLCFn, respectively, where n varies from 1 to NS. \n8) Find precision direction solution χn\nprcn around χn by finding minimum of \nMLCF2prcn through quadratic fit of MLCF2prcn values calculated for χ varied between χn \nand χn ±3δχ with 1° direction interval. \n9) Find WSn\nprcn and MLCFn\nprcn at the precision direction solution χn\nprcn following \nsteps (3 through 5) exploiting the wind speed regime of (χn - δχ)th trial direction. \n10) Repeat step 9 for all NS solutions. \n11) Rank wind vector solutions on the basis of MLCF values. The wind vector \nsolution having minimum MLCF is ranked as rank-1 solution and so on. \nIn step 8 for MLE and steps 5 and 6 for NSD implementations, the continuity of \nthe trial direction (circular data) and associated parameters around upwind direction is \nmaintained. The above schemes are found to be effective in finding precise solutions not \nonly for maintaining the direction retrieval skill of the algorithm under varying δχ (finer \nto coarser) and for minimizing the artifacts of search intervals and quadratic fitting but \nalso for enhancing the computational efficiency. The typical values of search intervals \nmentioned above are optimized based on the noise free cases considering the entire inner \nbeam swath including nadir region. The litmus test for proper implementation of the \nalgorithm is that the retrieval skill for the noise free cases must be 100%. The condition \nshown by expression (13) is effective in the situations when coarser search intervals of \ntrial direction are used. However, the coarser δχ should be avoided due to possibility of \nmissing proper solutions specifically over the nadir region and the retrieval becomes less \ncomputationally efficient. Moreover, δWS2 also cannot be increased in order to retain the \naccuracy of quadratic interpolation. The optimization of search interval, to some extent, \nalso depends upon the intervals of wind speed and direction specified in GMF. The values \nof search intervals δχ and δWS1 mentioned above are optimized based on the QSCAT-1 \nGMF. \n  \n \n19\nBased on simulations, primarily the evaluation of performances of the proposed \nalgorithm in successfully retrieving the wind direction under varying noise conditions has \nbeen carried out for the inner beam data swath region including nadir region. In order to \ncarry out simulation studies, radar backscatter data for Quikscat scatterometer \nobservational geometry is simulated with orbital altitude of 803 km and local incidence \nangles of 46° and 54° at the earth’s surface with horizontal and vertical polarization, \nrespectively. The outer beam swath is divided in a number of wind vector cells (WVC), \nand for each cell, azimuth angle with respect to sub-satellite track is calculated for each of \nthe antenna beams pointing to the cell. The cells with only four beams are used for the \nsimulation studies. At these WVC, radar backscatter data are simulated using QSCAT-1 \ngeophysical model function (rsd@zephyr2.jpl.nasa.gov) for simulated wind vector with \nwind speed and direction values varied within the specifications of QSCAT-1 GMF. The \ndetails of QSCAT-1 GMF are available online (Dunbar, 1999). The GMF backscatter \nvalue for any relative wind vector and incidence angle within GMF specifications can be \nobtained through bi-linear interpolation. The modification of simulated backscatter due to \nrain is realized through the rain model (Draper and Long, 2004) yielding the path \nintegrated attenuation PIA and the lump rain backscatter contribution σ0\nrw as functions of \nintegrated rain rate R expressed in  km.mm/hr as \n \n \nσ0\nr  = e-PIA.σ0\ng  + σ0\nrw \n16 \n \nBased on Quikscat data (25 km BUFR Format) for one orbit, the most prevalent \nvalues of α, β and γ with their respective standard deviations are used for simulating \nnoisy backscatter data for testing the algorithms. These parameters, in general, are \nexpressed here as  \n \nY(j) = Ym + V(j) \n17 \n \nwhere Y may be α, β or γ, with Ym as respective mean representative value. The Gausian \nrandom variable V(j) has zero mean and standard deviation as observed in Quikscat data \ngiven in table (4).  \n \n \n  \n \n20\n \n \nTable 4: Kp parameters of Quikscat data \nKp Parameter (Y) \nYm \nV \nD (kp_alpha-1) \n1.0.10-2 \n0.3.10-2 \nE \n1.0.10-5 \n0.3.10-5 \nJ \n1.0.10-7 \n0.3.10-7 \n \nFor each case of wind vector cell, wind vector and antenna beam, the values of α, \nβ and γ are generated to simulate the noisy backscatter (Oliphant and Long, 1999) as  \n \nσ0Mi = σ0G\ni (1+Kpi.Xi) \n18 \n \nwhere Xi is another independent Gausian random number with zero mean and the \nstandard deviation K. The value of standard deviation K is normally unity, however, it \ncan be varied for controlling the noise in simulation experiment. For noise free case, the \nvalue of K is zero and for noisy cases, it is varied from 1.0 to 2.0. The Kp is given by \nequation (7). While studying the impact of rain on wind vector retrieval, the rain model is \nused only for simulating the noisy backscatter data but not for the retrieval purpose.  \n \n5.1.2 Characteristics of wind retrieval across the inner beam swath: \n \nThe simulation experiment carried out for noise free cases provides an insight into \nthe characteristics of wind solutions at different locations of the swath. Over the sweet \nzone (Figure 9a) due to the optimum azimuth separation the sensitivity of cost function \n(NSD) with respect to aspect direction is higher. This leads to the retrieval skill relatively \nhigher as compared to the other regions due to optimum azimuth separation as well as \ndual polarized multi-look measurements. Over near nadir region, despite dual polarization \nmulti-look measurements, the azimuth separation is non-optimal leading to lower \nsensitivity of cost functions as seen in figure (9b) leading to reduced retrieval skill and \nhigher errors. At the sub-satellite track, the retrieval skill is approximately halved due to \n  \n \n21\npairing of solutions in terms of ranking criterion as seen in figure (9c). The retrieval \nerrors are also more due to non-optimal azimuth separation.  \n \n(a)\n0\n45\n90\n135\n180\n225\n270\n315\n360\nASPECT DIRECTION (DEG)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\nDERIVED WIND SPEED (m/s)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nNORMALISED WIND SPEED VARIABILITY\nNWV\nMEAN\nNoise-free Case, WVC # = 7/37\nTrue Wind Speed = 10 m/s\nTrue Wind Direction = 30 Deg\n(b)\n0\n45\n90\n135\n180\n225\n270\n315\n360\nASPECT DIRECTION (DEG)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\nDERIVED WIND SPEED (m/s)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nNORMALISED WIND SPEED VARIABILITY\nNWV\nMEAN\nNoise-free Case, WVC # = 16/37\nTrue Wind Speed = 10 m/s\nTrue Wind Direction = 30 Deg\n \n \n(c)\n0\n45\n90\n135\n180\n225\n270\n315\n360\nASPECT DIRECTION (DEG)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\nDERIVED WIND SPEED (m/s)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nNORMALISED WIND SPEED VARIABILITY\nNWV\nMEAN\nNoise-free Case, WVC # = 19/37\nTrue Wind Speed = 10 m/s\nTrue Wind Direction = 30 Deg\n \nFigure 9: Characteristics of wind solutions across the inner beam swath over, (a) Sweet \nzone, (b) near nadir zone, (c) sub-satellite location \n \n5.1.3 Comparison of retrieval algorithms and the noise sensitivity: \n \nThe retrieval performance (or skill) of an algorithm for a particularly ranked (first, \nsecond, etc) solution is defined in terms of percentage of total number of simulated wind \nvectors bearing that particular rank are closest to the wind directions used in simulating \nthe radar backscatter data through GMF. Algorithm implementation is verified by \nobserving 100 percent skill of top ranked solutions for noise-free condition (K=0) also \nwith even and odd intervals of trial direction for retrievals as well as for simulating \nbackscatter data. For MLE algorithm a small GMF modeling error (1.0e-14) is used to \navoid division by zero in MLCF calculations. For the swath location exactly at the sub-\nsatellite track where azimuth separation is 180, the skill is 50% irrespective of the \nalgorithm as pairing of solutions takes place with the same ranking.  \n  \n \n22\nThe performances of MLE and NSD algorithms are evaluated for K=1.5 as \ndepicted in figure (10a). The skill is evaluated separately for each wind vector cell \n(WVC) location numbered from 1 to 37 across the swath. The WVC numbered 19 \ncorresponds to the sub-satellite track position. The algorithm skill for each WVC is \nevaluated using wind vector cases with wind speed varying from 1 to 25 m/s with 2 m/s \ninterval and wind direction varying from 0° to 354° with 6° interval yielding total 780 \ndata points. The backscatter data are perturbed with noise controlled by parameter K with \nGMF modeling error of 1.0e-14. It is also observed from figure (10a) for K=1.5 that MLE \nand NSD algorithms have almost equal performances. The retrieval errors in wind speed \nand direction of both the algorithms as shown are found to be almost comparable. Apart \nfrom this, comparison of distribution of directions retrieved using these algorithms is also \nperformed as shown in figure (10b) and is also found to be mostly similar.  \n                         \n \n \nFigure 10: Characteristics of MLE and NSD algorithms, a) Comparison of direction \nretrieval skills and wind vector errors, b) Distribution of derived wind direction \nsolution closest to the true direction, (c) Comparison of algorithms’ performances \nand errors under varying noise conditions \n  \n \n23\n \nApart from comparison of performance of NSDA and MLE algorithms across the \ninner beam swath, impact of noise on retrieval performance has also been studied. Figure \n(10c) depicts the comparison of performances and errors of NSD and MLE algorithms \nunder varying noise conditions for all the WVC indicating similarity of these algorithms.  \nThus, NSD algorithm is found be as good as MLE algorithm in respect of \ndirection retrieval skill, wind vector errors and distribution of retrieved directions thus \nproviding an alternative to MLE but with better computational efficiency. However, the \nerrors in nadir regions are required to be improved using DIRTH algorithm developed by \nStiles et al (2002). \n \n5.2 Algorithm for directional ambiguity removal: \n \nA block diagram of directional ambiguity removal algorithm is depicted in figure \n(11). The ambiguity removal algorithm utilizes all the vector solutions available from \nretrieval algorithm over the data locations within the swath and the ambiguity is removed \nbased on the trend or the consensus of the rank-1 wind directions solutions over that area. \nIn most of the cases, about over half of the rank-1 wind directions are found to be aligned \nin the true wind directional pattern under normal noise conditions while the remaining \nrank-1 directions are mostly in the opposite direction. A median filtering approach is used \nto remove directional ambiguities.  \n \nOPTIMUM MEDIAN\nFILTER WINDOW \nHIGHEST RANK WIND \nVECTOR SOLUTION FIELD\nRESOLVE HIGHEST RANK VECTOR \nSOLNS FIELD INTO SCALAR FIELD\nCHOOSE SOLN CLOSEST TO MEDIAN \nVECTOR & SWAP SOLNS IF REQUIRED \nMEDIAN WIND \nVECTOR FIELD \nYES\nCHECK FOR CONVERGENCE OF\nHIGHEST RANK SOLNS FIELD\nAMBIGUITY FILTERED WIND VECTOR FIELD\nMEDIAN SCALAR \nWIND FIELDS \nITERATE PROCESS\nNO\n \nFigure 11: Block diagram of directional ambiguity removal algorithm \n \n  \n \n24\nFor this purpose, the rank-1 vectors over an area are first resolved into scalar \ncomponents.  With a moving window of optimized size, medians of both the scalars at \neach data location are determined using all the points falling within the window.  The \nmedians of respective scalars are used to find the median wind direction at each data \nlocation. Making use of median direction, all the direction solutions at that point are \nexamined and the direction solution closest to median direction is identified and that \nvector is assigned as rank-1 solution swapping with its original ranking (Gohil, 1992). \nThe procedure is followed for all the points in a scene cut out of the satellite pass and \nlikewise the entire pass is processed. The filtering process for a scene is repeated in the \nabove-mentioned manner till the entire processed wind field of that scene is converged.  \nAt this stage, the resulting wind field mostly resembles the true wind field in that scene.  \nIt is important to note that the retrieval of ambiguity filtered wind vector field is \nmainly dependent on the amount of noise present in radar backscatter data as well as on \nits spatial distribution.  \n \n5.2.1 Algorithm for localized directional ambiguity removal: \n \nIn case when the scatterometer data is highly noisy over certain parts of the swath, \nthe resulting wind field still may have localized ambiguities, which may not always be \npossible to be removed by the filtering process alone. Highly localized ambiguities may \nstill be removed using a filtering process over coarser spatial resolution data prepared \nfrom the given data. In this method, the filtered wind field with localized ambiguities is \nfurther divided into small segments. Medians of the same ranking solutions for these \ncoarser resolution data are obtained. The median solutions for these segments are further \nprocessed for ambiguity filtering as mentioned above. Based on filtered median wind \nfield, the original ambiguity filtered wind field with localized ambiguity is corrected to \nyield final filtered wind field (Gohil and Pandey, 1994).  \n \n5.2.2 Directional ambiguity removal over inner beam swath: \n \nThe directional ambiguity removal over the inner beam swath may be performed \nin a usual manner as described above by first ignoring the wind solutions exactly over the \nsub-satellite track. Wind solutions over a very narrow region around sub-satellite track \nbeing very erroneous are firstly required to be ignored because of the retrieval skill halved \n  \n \n25\ndue to the symmetry of the measurement geometry and the pairing of solutions as \nmentioned in earlier sections. Subsequent to the ambiguity filtering in rest of the inner \nbeam swath, wind solutions over the sub-satellite track should then be considered and the \nambiguity filtering process should be repeated. This approach is crude. However, the \nDIRTH algorithm (Stiles et al, 2002) must be used for the purpose and its implementation \nis being worked out. \nIt is important to note that while using pencil-beam scatterometer, a narrow \nregion of data swath centered at the sub-satellite track may have many data points with \nwind vector solutions not corresponding to the correct wind direction. This needs special \nprocessing and also requires external data like model surface analysis/forecast on \noperational basis. More so, in the outer region of the data swath where only two radar \nbackscatter observations are available, the ranking of wind vector solutions becomes \nirrelevant while one of the solutions represents true wind direction. This also needs \nexternal data like numerical weather prediction model winds for ranking the solutions. \n \n5.2.3 Directional ambiguity removal over exclusive outer beam swath: \n \nOver the exclusive outer beam swath region where the backscatter measurements \nfrom only one beam but in two azimuth directions are available, the wind vector solutions \ndo not have any meaningful ranking. Due to this reason, the derived solutions at all data \nlocations are assigned rank-1 priority based on the model wind direction and are used \nalong with inner beam solutions for ambiguity filtering through normal filter process as \nshown in block diagram of figure (12).  \nSweet Zone\nModel \nWinds\nRank of Soln\nTrue Wind Flow\nOuter Zone \n(No ranking)\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4\nAcross-Track\nAlong-\nTrack\n \nFigure 12: Role of model winds in tagging ranks to direction solutions over outer swath \n  \n \n26\nIn this process, certain weights are assigned to wind solutions depending upon its \ndistance from the outer edge of the swath of inner beam, otherwise, ambiguity filter \nprocess will yield wind field more resembling to the model winds loosing the impact of \nmeasurements. Further details given by Stiles et al, (2002) are being worked out.  \n \n5.2.4 Testing of algorithms with Quikscat data:  \n \nThe present algorithm has been tested with Quikscat data (MGDR NRT Version \nin BUFR format at 25 km spatial resolution) for one orbit (#29820) on March 11, 2005, at \n12.00 GMT over inner beam swath only. Based on median filter, the directional \nambiguity is removed using a two-step filtering at given and coarser spatial resolutions. \nQuikscat data derived wind fields using NSD and MLE algorithms are depicted in figures \n(13a) and (13b), respectively.  \n \n \n \nFigure 13: Ocean surface wind vector field derived from Quikscat radar backscatter data \n(NRT BUFR-25 km) over inner beam swath for March 11, 2005 over Indian \nregion using, a) NSD algorithm, b) MLE algorithm \n  \n \n27\n \nThe derived winds are found to be very similar to each other as well with those of \nfinished product winds (not depicted here). More so, the computational efficiency of the \npresent algorithm is found to be higher (about 2 to 3 times) as compared to that of MLE \nalgorithm during simulation studies as well as testing with Quikscat data (Gohil et al, \n2006). \n \n6.0 Flagging: \n \nRetrieval of ocean surface wind vector from scatterometer is affected in the \npresence of rain due to modification of measured radar backscatter in two ways. During \nrain, the drops falling on water surface create crater, crown, stalk and ring waves. Out of \nthese, ring waves contribute the most towards radar backscatter through Bragg resonance. \nBesides, rain attenuates the radar signal as well as contributes through volume \nbackscattering. A study of rain impact on backscatter and associated wind vector retrieval \nis required for rain flagging of backscatter data. \nDue to the directional symmetry of ring waves and the scattering from water drops \nin rain column the backscatter signals are depolarized causing diminishing difference of \nradar backscatter in vertical and horizontal polarizations. However, high intensity winds \nunder rain-free conditions also lead to depolarization. The normalized polarization \ndifference is found to have a potential for pre-retrieval rain flagging. Under moderate and \nhigh rain conditions, pre-retrieval rain flagging is feasible. Light rain and high wind \nconditions lead to false/missing rain flagging. The impact of rain is also observed in terms \nof drastic changes in retrieved wind speed and direction. Retrieval of wind vector under \nraining conditions is highly erroneous and mostly renders retrieval meaningless. This \nneeds rain affected data to be ignored (or flagged out). In the present study, only rain \nflagging of data using the retrieval algorithm by Gohil et al (2006) has been attempted \nfollowing procedures given by Portabella and Stoffelen (2001) yielding different success \nrates for rain-free and rainy conditions. The rain-flagging scheme has been tested with \nsimulated data and the success rate of rain flagging under rain-free and rainy situations \nhas been evaluated under different noise scenario. Under rain-free situations it is observed \nthat the false reporting of rain cases is significantly low while for rainy cases, the missing \nrain events are, to some extent, high but are comparable with the studies made elsewhere. \nSpatial analysis of real data may further improve flagging. \n  \n \n28\n \n6.1 Rain impact model and its development: \n \nAn empirical rain impact model for QuikSCAT to calculate rain affected radar \nbackscatter over ocean is given by Draper and Long (2004) as \n \n σ0\nm = αrain(σ0\nwind  + σ0\nrainstrike)+ σ0\nrain \n19 \n \nWhere σ0\nm is the measured Quikscat backscatter, σ0\nwind is the rain-free wind-induced \nradar backscatter, σ0\nrainstrike is the surface backscatter perturbation due rain striking the \nocean surface,\nrain\nα\n is the two way atmospheric rain attenuation, and σ0\nrain is the volume \nscattering due to falling rain droplets. The model is further simplified by summing the \nattenuated surface perturbation and the atmosphere scattering terms, creating a single \n(lump) effective rain backscatter. The resultant rain impact model is \n \nσ0\nm = αrain.σ0\nwind + σ0\nrainy \n20 \nwith \n αrain = Σ \n2 \nk=0 AkRk \n21 \n \nσ0\nrain = Σ \n2 \nk=0 SkRk \n22 \n \nwhere R (km.mm/hr) is integrated rain rate. The σ0\nwind information is obtained from \nQSCAT-1 GMF for a known wind vector. Based on the above model, variations of \natmospheric transmittance (τ=e-α) and lump rain backscatter varying with integrated rain \nrate, for horizontal and vertical polarizations, are depicted in figure (14). \n \n  \n \n29\n \nFigure (14): Variation of atmospheric transmittance (solid lines) and lump rain \nbackscatter (dotted lines) with integrated rain for Quikscat scatterometer \n \nIt indicates that for both the polarizations, atmospheric transmittance nonlinearly \ndecreases while lump rain backscatter nonlinearly increases with increasing rain rate. This \nempirical rain impact model is developed using simultaneously observed radar \nbackscatter from Quikscat scatterometer, path integrated attenuation and rain rate profile \nfrom TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR), oceans surface wind vector from NCEP model \nanalysis and the QSCAT-1 GMF. Development of such model specific to Oceansat-2 \nscatterometer will be essential in which radar backscatter data from Oceasat-2 \nscatterometer will be used along with rain and attenuation information from TRMM-PR \nand model wind data from ECMWF/NCEP. Prior to developing rain impact model, \ndevelopment of GMF specific to Oceansat-2 scatterometer will be necessary. The data \nrequirements for rain impact model development are the same as reflected in table (3) \nwith additional data of path-integrated attenuation from TRMM-PR. \n \n6.2 Impact of rain on wind vector retrieval:  \n \nThe impact of rain is studied through wind vectors retrieved by the method \nmentioned above by using simulated radar backscatter under rainy conditions obtained \nthrough equation (20). The impact of rain is observed in terms of drastic changes in \nretrieved wind speed and direction as shown in figures (15). The retrieved wind speed \n  \n \n30\nbelow and above 15 m/s are over- and under- estimated, respectively as seen in figure \n(15a), while retrieved directions are aligned towards direction normal to sub-satellite \ntrack as observed in figure (15b). These observed characteristics under rainy conditions \nare utilized to flag the retrievals under rainy situations as mentioned subsequently.  \n \n(a)\n   (b)\n \nFigure 15: Impact of rain on retrieval, (a) on retrieved speed, (b) on retrieved direction \n \n6.3 Rain flagging: \n \nRetrieval of wind vector under raining conditions is highly erroneous and is \nrendered meaningless. This needs rain affected data to be ignored (or flagged). Under \nvery low intensity rain situations, winds can be retrieved with due corrections to \nbackscatter through simultaneous retrieval of wind and rain using MLE (Draper and Long \n2004a). Presently, only rain flagging of data using NSD algorithm has been attempted \nfollowing the approach by Portabella and Stoffelen (2001) yielding different success rates \nfor rain-free and rainy conditions. For rain flagging, the NSD values under rain-free and \nrainy situations have been compared keeping the observed behavior of the derived wind \nvectors in view. Rain rates from 0 to 50 km.mm/hr with an interval of 10 km.mm/hr are \nconsidered. The trends of variation of rank-1 SD values under rain-free and rainy \nconditions as shown in figure (16a) are found to be separable, hence, can be used for rain \nflagging. The SD values for rain-free and under low to moderate rain conditions are \noverlapping which primarily lead to such rain events undetected. However, apart from \nthis, another useful clue used here is that the retrieved wind directions under rainy \nsituations are mostly found to be around directions normal to the sub-satellite track. Thus \na criterion is chosen to flag out possible raining situations in the data based on the above \n  \n \n31\ninformation. The trends of wind speed binned mean and standard deviation of rank-1 SD \nwith corresponding wind speed are established for all WVC as shown in figure (16b). The \nnonlinearly fitted mean and standard deviation of rank-1 SD are used for rain flagging \n(Portabella and Stoffelen, 2001). The rank-1 retrieved wind vector solution is assumed to \nbe referring to raining condition if the following conditions are satisfied: 1) the retrieved \nwind speed WS1\nPRCN is above 7.0 m/s, 2) the difference of retrieved wind direction χ1\nPRCN \nwith direction normal to sub-satellite track (∆χ1\nPRCN) satisfies the condition \n|Cos(∆χ1\nPRCN)| ≤ 0.275 and, 3) the difference of observed SD1\nPRCN and calculated rain-\nfree SDRFAVG satisfies the condition ∆SD1\nPRCN > 0.7.MSD.SDRFSD, with ∆SD1\nPRCN = \n|SD1\nPRCN - SDRFAVG|, while SDRFAVG and SDRFSD are given by \n \nSDRFAVG = Σ\n3 \nQ=0AQ( WS1\nPRCN)Q   and   SDRFSD = Σ\n3 \nQ=0DQ( WS1\nPRCN)Q \n23 \n \nwhere, AQ and DQ are the polynomial coefficients for average (solid line through \n“ diamond” symbols) and standard deviation (dotted line through “ plus” symbols) fitted \ncurves of SD, respectively, as shown in figure (16b). \nThe fitted curves used for calculating SDRFAVG and SDRFSD are shown in figure \n(16b). The threshold multiplier MSD varying from 1.8 to 2.2 is used for rain detection and \nhas impact on rain detection under rain-free and rainy situations as shown in figure (16c). \nThe above scheme has been tested with simulated data and the performance of rain \nflagging under rain-free and rainy situations has been evaluated as depicted in figure \n(16c). The overall proportionate success is a weighted success considering fractions of \nrain-free (about 90 percent) and rainy (about 10 percent) events at any given time over the \nglobe as reported in literature (Portabella and Stoffelen, 2001; Stiles and Yueh, 2002; \nDraper and Long, 2004; Huddleston and Stiles, 2000). For no-rain situations it is \nobserved that the false reporting of rain cases is significantly low while for raining cases, \nthe missing rain events are, to some extent, high but are comparable with the studies \nmade elsewhere (Portabella and Stoffelen, 2001; Huddleston and Stiles, 2000). \n \n  \n \n32\n          \n              \n \n \n         \n \n \nFigure (16): Rain flagging using NSD algorithm at K=1.5, a) Scatter plots of rank-1 SD \nand rank-1 wind speed under rain-free and rain conditions, b) Trends of rain-free \nmean and standard deviation of rank-1 SD for binned wind speed considering all \nWVC, c) Rain flagging performance for rain-free and rainy situations for different \nflagging thresholds. \n \n6.4 Sea-ice flagging (Brief introduction): \n \nSea-ice altering the radar backscatter measurements affects the wind retrieval. The \nradar backscattered signal from the earth’s surface is dependent on the roughness at the \nscale of the radar wave length, the incidence angle, and the dielectric properties of the \nsurface, which for sea ice means ice salinity, temperature, air inclusion, liquid water \nfraction in snow and ice, and snow cover (Haarpaintner et al, 2004). At low wind speeds, \nhorizontal polarization backscatter from the ocean is generally lower than backscatter \n  \n \n33\nfrom ice but higher wind speed may produce ambiguities for ice-ocean discrimination \nbecause ice and ocean may exhibit similar mean backscatter values. Haarpaintner et al \n(2004) have given an approach (referred hereafter as HA) for sea-ice delineation making \nuse of active polarization ratio (APR) and radar backscatter values. The APR is given as \n \nAPR = (σ0H - σ0V)/ (σ0H + σ0V) \n24 \n \nWhere σ0H, σ0V are radar backscatter on linear scale. Based on a number of criteria given \nin HA, the ice-flagging scheme is being considered for Oceanat-2 scatterometer. A \nlimited number of criteria given in HA used here, are given in table (5). \n \n Table 5: Ice-ocean thresholds \nParameter \nValue \nAPR \n>-0.02 \nV0V \n>-25 dB \nV0H \n>-25 dB \nData satisfying these conditions is treated as ice\n \nSome of the results, on the basis of a limited criterion of HA, obtained from \nQuikscat radar backscatter products (BYU products) are presented here as a preliminary \neffort towards sea-ice flagging for Oceansat-2 (Rao, 2007). Shown in figure (17) are APR \nvalues obtained using Quikscat data for different dates during year 2000 indicating the \npresence of sea ice.  \n \n(a)\n        (b)\n \nFigure 17: Quikscat backscatter BYU product derived APR over Southern Polar region \nindicating sea-ice coverage for different dates (a) 11-02-2000, and (b) 17-08-2000 \n  \n \n34\nHowever, over ocean, some of the spurious data indicating sea-ice are also seen \nwhich may be due to higher winds as well as APR calculated at the edge of inner beam \nswath. Given here is only an introduction to the activity while detailed plan is being \nworked out separately (not a part of wind retrieval). \n \n7.0 Initial phase validation: \nThis aspect to some extent is taken care during GMF development phase which \nwill also include limited validation of GMF and the derived winds. However, \ncalibration/validation activities are being pursued separately. \n \n8.0 Limitations: \n \nThe major limitation is that the retrievals under cyclonic conditions are highly \nerroneous in terms of wind speed and direction as the cyclones are mostly associated with \nrain. This needs cyclonic data to be properly identified and processed in a proper manner \ntaking care of rain (simultaneous retrievals). Apart from this, regions with highly variable \nwind fields like fronts, cols, vortices and others in the presence of large noise the \ndirectional ambiguities may not be properly filtered out. Due to different processes to be \nincorporated for outer and nadir regions, discontinuities in the direction fields may occur \nin some cases. \n \n9.0 Acknowledgements \n \nAuthors wish to thank Dr. R.

Most of the ISRO’s space-borne sensors only partially fulfil the mentioned \ncapabilities. As far as the requirement of narrow multiple channels in the visible region, and \nradiometric quality of the measurement is concerned, Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM-2) on-board \nOceanSat-2 seems to be a good choice, however, spectral coverage in OCM-2 is only up to 0.865 µm, \nwhich omitted the idea of aerosol remote sensing over land with existing algorithm. For this reason, \nto date OCM-2 was limited to ocean colour applications only. \nThis Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) describes a novel algorithm for remote sensing of \naerosol over land using spectral reflectance observed by OCM-2. The algorithm retrieves the aerosol \noptical depth (AOD) as the primary product and fine mode fraction as a proxy for the size distribution \n(can be associated with anthropogenic sources) of the undisturbed aerosol column over most of the \nIndian landmass. The unique characteristic of OCM-2 is the presence of two narrow blue channels \n(0.44 and 0.49 um), which is taken as an advantage in this algorithm for the resolution of aerosol type \nwhile optical depth inversion. The presence of two blue channels also allows full use of red and near-\ninfrared (NIR) channels for surface characterization without any assumption on the transparency of \naerosol in red and NIR bands. These two facts make this algorithm different from existing ones and \nalso make aerosol remote sensing possible with OCM-2 sensor which does not have measurement \ncapabilities beyond NIR like MODIS, VIIRS, and GOES-R, and do not have multi- viewings like MISR and \nPARASOL. The high brightness combined with spatial homogeneity of clouds in visible channels allows \nreasonably good cloud rejection while aerosol estimation. Co-located sun photometer validation is \nprovided for the aerosol product.  \nThe prime objectives for developing this aerosol product are to cater main input for air-quality, \nradiative budget, and climate applications, especially over Indian landmass.  The high spatial \nresolution of 700 meters makes this product unique among globally available aerosol products. Apart \nfrom these, it will open the door for the utilization of OCM-2 data for other land applications also. \nSince OCM-2 in local area coverage mode have 2-day repetivity, the temporal resolution of OCM-2 \nAOD is two days, with an exception for the overlap region where daily retrievals are possible. \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nContents \nList Figures \nList of Tables \nList of Acronyms and Symbols \n1.0 \nAlgorithm Configuration Information \n1.1 \nAlgorithm Name \n1.2 \nAlgorithm Identifier \n1.3 \nAlgorithm Specification \n2.0 \nIntroduction \n2.1 \nOverview and background \n2.2 \nObjectives \n3.0 \nInputs \n3.1 \nStatic Data \n3.2 \nImage and pre-processing data (Dynamic) \n3.3 \nOther Auxiliary data and Model Inputs \n4.0 \nAlgorithm Functional Specifications \n4.1 \nOverview \n4.2 \nInstrument Characteristics \n4.3 \nTheoretical background \n4.3.1  \nGas absorption \n4.3.2  \nCloud and inland water masking \n  \n \n4.3.3  \nPhysical basis and model for surface characterization \n4.3.4  \nRadiative transfer calculations \n4.3.5  \nAerosol inversion \n4.4 \nFlowchart \n4.5 \nOperational Implementation \n5.0 \nOutputs \n5.1 \nFormat of the output and the domain \n6.0 \nValidation \n6.1 \nData required \n6.2 \nMethods of validation \n6.2.1  \nAERONET data for validation \n6.2.2  \nHandheld sun photometer validation \n6.2.3  \nSatellite-based Inter-comparisons \n6.3 \nProvisional validation \n6.3.1  \nDerived AOD maps \n6.3.2  \nValidation results with AERONET data \n7.0 \nTechnical issues (Limitations etc.) \n8.0 \nFuture scope \n9.0 \nDiscussion \n10.0 \nReferences \n4 \n \nList of Figures \nFigure 1.

Aerosols have largescale \neffects, such as their impact on climate by redistributing solar radiation (IPCC 2007; Charlson et al. \n1991; Haywood et al. 1999) and interacting with clouds (Platnick and Twomey 1994; Kaufman et \nal. 2002). Aerosol information is also critical for atmospheric correction algorithms for multi-\nspectral satellite sensors and military operations. The climate effects of atmospheric aerosols may \nbe comparable to carbon dioxide greenhouse effects, but with opposite signs and larger \nuncertainty (Hansen and Lacis, 1990). Aerosols have a significant impact on human life beyond the \nclimate element. When in the lower troposphere aerosols cause poor air quality, reduction of \nvisibility, and public health hazards. Satellite remote sensing provides a means to derive aerosol \ndistribution at global and regional scales.  \nThis Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) describes the algorithm used to retrieve the \nAerosol Optical Depth (AOD) for the OCM-2 instrument onboard OceanSat-2 a polar-orbiting \nplatform. The output product description is summarized in Table 1.  \nSpecifically, this document identifies the sources of input data, both OCM-2 data and non- OCM-2 \ndata, required for retrieval; provides the physical theory and mathematical background underlying \nthe use of this information in the retrievals; includes implementation details; describes \nassumptions and limitations of the proposed approach. \nTable 1.

The \n8 \n \nsecondary objective is to derive fine-mode fraction which is a proxy information about the particle \nsize distribution and can be associated with anthropogenic sources of aerosols. The overall \nobjectives of the aerosol retrieval are:  \n \nTo determine the aerosol optical thickness, at 550 nm and 700-meter spatial resolution \nover land within an uncertainty of 20%.  \n \nTo derive fine mode fraction as a qualitative indicator of anthropogenic pollution sources. \nAs clouds block the surface reflectance, the aerosol optical depth cannot be found for cloudy pixels \ntherefore optical thickness retrievals apply only under clear and daytime conditions. \n \n3.0 Inputs \n3.1 Static Data \nInput Name \nResolution \nUnits \nSource \nDigital elevation \nmodel (DEM) \n1.0 km \nmeters \n(GLOBE) Digital Elevation \nModel, Version 1.0, NOAA, \n(Hastings et al., 1999) \nSpectral response \nfunction (SRF) \n1.0 nanometres \ndimensionless  \nSEDA/SAC/ISRO \n \n3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic) \nInput Name \nResolution \nQuantization \nUnits \nSource \nOCM-2 radiometrically \ncorrected TOA \nradiance in channels \ncentred at 443, 490, \n550, 620 and 865 nm \n360 x 250 \nmeters \n12 bit \nmW/cm2/nm/sr \nHDF L1 B data file (NRSC) \nSun-sensor geometry \npixel \n- \ndegree \nHDF L1 B data file (NRSC) \nLatitude/Longitude \npixel \n- \n0N / 0E \nHDF L1 B data file (NRSC) \n \n3.3 Other Auxiliary data and Model Inputs \nInput Name \nResolution \nUnits \nSource \nOzone \n1.0 x 1.25 degree, \nMonthly \nDobson \nTOMS, NASA (Richard et al., \n1998) \nSimulated TOA \nradiance \n6 degree interval sun-\nsensor geometry angles \nmW/cm2/nm/sr \nPre-calculated from RT \nmodel \nFine mode aerosol \ntype \n1 degree \ndimensionless \nLevy et al., 2007 (based on \nin-situ data from AEROET) \n4.0 Algorithm Functional Specifications \n4.1 Overview \n9 \n \nAerosol retrievals from polar-orbiting satellite data, such as Moderate Resolution Imaging \nSpectroradiometer (MODIS) of NASA’s, Aqua and Terra Satellites, Visible Infrared Imaging \nRadiometer Suite (VIIRS), Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), PARASOL are the major \nsources of high-quality global estimates of AOD over land and oceans (Kaufman et al., 1997; Levy \net al., 2007; Hsu et al., 2004, 2006, 2013).  All of these sensors of foreign space agencies are \nequipped with the channels to measure radiances in several narrow visible, near Infrared (NIR) \nand short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands. In addition to measuring un-polarized spectral \nradiances at a single scattering angle, some of these sensors such as MISR and PARASOL can also \nmeasure un-polarized as well as polarized radiances at several scattering angles, thus providing \nmore scope to improve the accuracy of AOD retrieval as well as aerosol optical properties. Most \nof these sensors utilize the dark-target method over dark vegetated surfaces and the deep-blue \nmethod over bright surfaces to retrieve AOD products. Both of these methods require spectral \nradiance measurement in at least three visible channels (near 440,490, 620 nm) and two SWIR \nchannels (1.24 & 2.12 um) for aerosol retrieval in addition to channels required for masking \nunwanted target pixels.  \nAs far as Indian satellites are concerned, none of the existing sensors fulfils the requirements of \nmeasurement in all channels especially the SWIR channels, which is crucial for aerosol retrieval. \nMost of the spaceborne optical imaging sensors onboard different Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) \nsatellites such as OceanSat (1, 2 and upcoming 3), CARTOSAT (1, 2 and 3) and RESOURCESAT (1 \nand 2), etc. were designed for specific applications related to Earth surface (land and ocean) \nmonitoring and mapping, as in various EOS missions, and were not designed to accommodate \nchannels for aerosol studies. For this reason, the existing AOD retrieval techniques requiring SWIR \nand visible channels, in multiple wavelengths, cannot be used for Aerosol retrieval from any of the \nISRO sensors’ data. INSAT-3D/3DR is the only exception, where utilizing the advantage of fixed \nview geometry due to Geostationary platform, a basic AOD product using single visible channel \ndata without the need of SWIR measurement is operationally generated and is available for public \nuse, on the SAC/VEDAS site (Mishra et al., 2018). However, this method is not so efficient or \naccurate and is not suited to good accuracy aerosol retrieval, which limits its use to qualitative \nestimate purpose, and time-series change monitoring only.  \nThe reason for less research work toward the development of aerosol retrieval algorithm for \nsingle-view visible to near-infrared (VNIR) sensor in past may be due to significant aerosol \ncontamination in the entire VNIR spectral range that makes surface characterization a difficult \nproblem. Moreover, since electromagnetic radiation of SWIR (2µm) wavelength minimally interact \n10 \n \nwith aerosols therefore researchers found MODIS-like sensors more feasible for developing \nrelatively simpler aerosol retrieval algorithm.  \nThus, due to the impracticality of implementation of existing AOD retrieval methods to ISRO’s \noperational satellites’ data, routine accurate AOD retrieval could not be done. However, \nextremely poor air quality over Indian landmass, especially the urban centers, and the high priority \nrequirement from Environment Ministries, for high resolution (sub kilometres) aerosol \nestimations to generate ground-level PM2.5/PM10 maps, using existing Indian satellite sensor’s \ndata, an urgent need was there to develop techniques for retrieving reliable and accurate aerosol \ninformation from the existing Indian satellite sensors. Recent research work at Space Applications \nCenter, ISRO, provides a unique solution to this. The research has led to the development of a \nNovel Technique, which can retrieve AOD from Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) data onboard IRS \nOceanSat-2 satellite, which was launched in 2009 and is still in-service. This Algorithm Theoretical \nBasis Document briefly describes this aerosol algorithm and the aerosol product of which \nAOD@550 nm beta version is currently operational at VEDAS/SAC/ISRO air quality portal \n(https://vedas.sac.gov.in/vstatic/AQ/index.html). \n \nFigure 1. Spectral responses functions of Ocean Colour Monitor bands. \n \n4.2 Instrument Characteristics \nThe OceanSat-2 was launched in 2009 and was placed in a near-circular sun-synchronous orbit, at \nan altitude of 720 Km, with an equatorial crossing time of around 1200 hrs. Ocean Colour Monitor \nis a VNIR sensor on-board OceanSat-2, which acquires top of the atmosphere radiance in 8 narrow \nspectral channels centered at wavelengths, 412, 443, 490, 510, 550, 620, 740, and 865 nm with \nhigh radiometric accuracy. Since 2010 (i.e., for the last 11 years) OCM-2 is continuously providing \ndata over the ocean as well as on land and is still in service. Since OCM-2 is particularly designed \nfor ocean colour studies, the ocean observation is planned at the local time of equator crossing \n11 \n \ntime of 1200 hours noon, the camera can be tilted up to ± 20° in the along-track direction to avoid \nsun glint. Table 2 shows the salient characteristics of the OCM-2 sensor. Figure 1 shows the \nspectral responses of the channels. OCM-2 data is available in two spatial resolutions: Local Area \nCoverage (LAC) of 360 m and Global Area Coverage (GAC) of 1 km. To meet the objective of \ncovering oceans around the Indian region, Real-Time LAC data is routinely received at the NRSC \nprimary ground station. The area of coverage in LAC mode is shown in figure 2. Table 3 shows \nvarious performance parameters of OCM-2. \nTable 2.

AOD is the degree to \nwhich aerosol prevents the transmission of the light by absorption or scattering of light and is \ndefined as the integrated extinction coefficient of light due to aerosol over a vertical atmospheric \ncolumn of unit cross-section (mathematically represented by equation 1). Extinction coefficient \n𝐾𝑒𝑥𝑡  is defined as the fractional depletion of radiance per unit length. \n𝜏= ∫𝐾𝑒𝑥𝑡(𝑧)𝑑𝑧\n𝑙\n0\n                                                                                                                                               (1) \nThe following description is intended to provide the basic structure of the algorithm that can \nderive aerosol optical depth and fine mode fraction from OceanSat-2 OCM data, which acquires \ntop of the atmosphere radiance in 8 narrow spectral channels centered at wavelengths, 412, 443, \n490, 510, 550, 620, 740 and 865 nm with high radiometric accuracy. The overall workflow for the \nproposed algorithm/technique for aerosol retrieval using OCM-2 data is shown in section 4.4. It \nmainly involves four components:  \n(a) Masking of the pixel for which retrieval is not possible (e.g., cloud, water, and saturated pixels), \n(b) The surface characterization in visible-channels,  \n(c) Radiative transfer simulation, and  \n(d) The aerosol inversion. \n13 \n \nThe aerosol retrieval algorithm described in this ATBD is novel/different from other existing \naerosol retrieval algorithms such as dark-target or deep-blue in many ways that make it capable \nto derive aerosols from VNIR sensors. Following are the salient points of the algorithm: \n(a) The surface characterization in visible channels is shown to be possible by the use of near \nInfrared channel measurements, where the existing algorithm uses the SWIR channel over \ndark targets and reflectivity database over bright surfaces. Thus this algorithm avoids the \nnecessity of SWIR measurement as well as doesn’t require the pre-existence of a surface \nreflectivity database. \n(b) Different from the dark-target algorithm, the surface characterization strategy in this \nalgorithm is not limited to vegetative surfaces but is also valid over moderately bright surfaces, \nwhich enables AOD retrieval over both moderately bright as well as dark surfaces. \n(c) Different from the dark-target, deep-blue algorithm and others where blue and red channels \nare used for aerosol inversion, in this algorithm aerosol inversion is based on two blue \nchannels which allows more accurate selection of aerosol types and also increases the \nprobability of retrieval over bright targets.  \nApart from this many other differences such as red and NIR bands are not assumed transparent, \nsimultaneous retrieval of aerosol and surface in NIR and red bands, etc., makes the current aerosol \nretrieval algorithm novel when compared to existing ones, though none of them are feasible for \nimplementation with OCM-2 sensor. \n4.3.1 Gas absorption \nIn addition to the aerosols and molecular scattering, certain atmospheric gases may also affect \nOCM-2 channels. In the VNIR region, primarily three atmospheric gas may absorb the incident \nsolar radiation and upwelling radiation namely water vapour (H2O), ozone (O3), and oxygen (O2). \nThe expression for ozone optical thickness, 𝜏𝑜𝑧(𝜆) for OCM: \n𝜏𝑜𝑧(𝜆) = 𝐾𝑜𝑧(𝜆) 𝐷𝑈     \n \n \n \n \n(1) \nwhere, 𝐷𝑈 refer to total column ozone in Dobson unit and  𝐾𝑜𝑧(𝜆) is the extinction coefficient \nthat relates optical thickness with concentration. Table 4 show the values of  𝐾𝑜𝑧(𝜆) for OCM-\n2 channels. From table 4 it can be seen that band-5 and band-6 centered at 550 and 620 nm, \nrespectively are significantly affected by ozone absorption. The top of the atmosphere radiance \nis corrected by ozone transmittance. The relation for the ozone transmittance is: \n𝑇𝑜𝑧= exp [−𝜏𝑜𝑧(𝜆){(𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃)−1 + (𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃0)−1}]   \n \n (2) \n14 \n \nSince OCM-2 channels are selected in atmospheric windows, therefore, absorption due to water \nvapour and oxygen is expected to be insignificant. To verify this figure 3 shows the \ntransmittance due to water vapour at different concentrations (2, 4, and 6 cm) and the standard \nvalue of oxygen for the tropical atmosphere. From figure 3, it is clear that that band 2, 3, 5 and \n6 are completely free from the water vapour or oxygen absorption. Band 8 is also almost free \nfrom water vapour but with very little contamination, however. Table 5 shows the water vapour \ntransmittance obtained after convolving the transmittance curve with band-8 spectral response \nfunction, where form it is verified that the contamination is not more than 1% even at high \nwater vapour content of around 6 cm. There may be an error of about 1-2% if water vapour \ncontent is very high >6 cm but such conditions are rare and often gets masked as clouds. \nTable 4.

In normal conditions, heavy/thick clouds can be distinguished and masked \njust by applying an appropriate threshold on visible channel measurements, however, thin \nclouds especially at cloud edges frequently create problems. An astringent threshold can be \nused to mask such pixels but it also masks heavy aerosol plumes. For this reason in the present \nalgorithm, a visible channel threshold is used to mask thick clouds only. For masking scattered \nclouds, a spatial homogeneity test is performed by estimating the standard deviation over a \nrunning window of 3x3 pixels. An appropriate threshold is used to detect scattered cloudy \npixels keeping the fact in mind that the land surface is more homogeneous than the scattered \nclouds. For cloud masking following 2 tests are performed: \n(a) Visible channel (band-2) reflectance threshold test: \n 𝜌443 𝑛𝑚 > 0.30             Pixel is considered cloudy.                                        (3) \n(b) Threshold test on the standard deviation of a running 3 x 3-pixel window of band-2 image.  \n𝜎443𝑛𝑚,3 𝑥 3 > 0.02             Center pixel is considered cloudy.                    (4) \nThe inland water mask is determined by computing the traditional NDVI like parameter \n(NDVI’) for the 0.62 μm and the 0.865 μm channels.  \n𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼′ =\n𝜌𝐵8,𝑇𝑂𝐴−𝜌𝐵6,𝑇𝑂𝐴\n𝜌𝐵8,𝑇𝑂𝐴+𝜌𝐵6,𝑇𝑂𝐴 \n \n \n                                            (5) \nIf  𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼′ < 0.05 then the pixel is considered water contaminated and is masked. \nThe test for pixel saturation is also performed using saturation radiance (𝐿𝑠𝑎𝑡 ) values for each \nband. If measured radiance (𝐿𝐵) in any band satisfies the condition \n 𝐿𝐵> 𝐿𝑠𝑎𝑡                                             \n \n \n    \n             (6) \nthen the pixel is considered saturated and is masked. \nAny pixel with solar zenith angle (𝜃0) or sensor zenith angle (𝜃0) above-given limits are also \nmasked. The condition for the high zenith angle test is given by: \n𝜃0 > 720     or   𝜃> 840   \n \n \n \n \n \n(7) \n \n4.3.3 Physical basis and model for surface characterization \nThe physical basis behind surface characterization in visible channels using NIR \nchannels is based on the fact that over the vegetated surface, the surface reflectance \nin the blue spectral region is low due to absorption of solar radiation by chlorophyll while in \nthe NIR region the surface reflectance becomes high due to specular reflection from the \n16 \n \nleaves. Using this fact appropriate function of the form shown in equation 8 can be developed \nto characterize the surface reflectance in blue and red channels knowing the surface \nreflectance in NIR channels and an appropriate vegetation index. For the case of OCM-2 data, \nthe vegetation index used is NDVI, blue and red, and NIR channels used are centered at 443 \nnm, 490 nm, 620 nm, and 865 nm. \n𝜌𝑏𝑙𝑢𝑒\n𝑠𝑢𝑟= 𝑓(𝜌𝑁𝐼𝑅\n𝐴𝑡.𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟, 𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼),                                                                                   \n (8) \n𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼=\n𝜌𝑁𝐼𝑅\n𝐴𝑡.𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟−𝜌𝑟𝑒𝑑\n𝐴𝑡.𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 \n𝜌𝑁𝐼𝑅\n𝐴𝑡.𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟+𝜌𝑟𝑒𝑑\n𝐴𝑡.𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟                                                                                                       (9) \n𝜌λ\n𝐴𝑡.𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟= \n𝜌λ\n𝑇𝑂𝐴(𝛺0,𝛺)−𝑇𝑔(𝛺0,𝛺)𝜌λ\n𝑅𝐴(𝛺0,𝛺,𝜏)\n𝑇𝑔(𝛺0,𝛺)𝑇(𝛺0,𝜏)𝑇(𝛺,𝜏)+𝑆λ(𝜏)[𝜌λ\n𝑇𝑂𝐴(𝛺0,𝛺)−𝑇𝑔(𝛺0,𝛺)𝜌λ\n𝑅𝐴(𝛺0,𝛺,𝜏)]                          (10) \nFor developing relation given in equation (8), around 1860 OCM-2 datasets (for the year 2017) \nwere processed and corrected for aerosol and gas absorption at 22 AERONET stations (located \nin India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Myanmar)  using in-situ aerosol, water vapour, and \nozone information. After cloud screening of both AERONET and OCM-2 data around 700 co-\nlocated data-points are selected for model development. Radiative transfer calculations were \nused to generate benchmark datasets of surface reflectance for each spectral channel. The \nperformance of function developed to estimate band-3 and band-6 surface reflectance using \nNIR channel is shown in figure 3. From figure 3 it is seen that surface reflectance in band-3 can \nbe estimated using both red as well as NIR bands and NDVI within root mean square error \n(rmse) of around 0.02. For lower surface reflectance the scatter is less while on bright surfaces \nthe significant scatter is observed. In figure 4, the data point density is higher for low surface \nreflectance pixels, which in general true as natural targets are dark in blue wavelengths, \ntherefore excluding bright surface the rmse will become significantly lower than 0.02. In a \nsimilar way, function to estimate surface reflectivity in band-2 using band-3 is also developed.  \n \nFigure 4. Scatter plot for modelled surface reflectance in band-3 and band-6 versus surface \nreflectance obtained by atmospheric correction using in-situ data.  \n17 \n \n4.3.4 Radiative transfer calculations \nRadiative Transfer (RT) simulation is another important step towards aerosol retrieval in which \nthe method of discrete ordinate is used to solve the RT equation (equation 11) for simulating \nvarious radiative quantities for different possible aerosol atmospheres and illumination-view \ngeometries.  \n𝜇\n𝑑𝐼(𝜏,𝛺)\n𝑑𝜏\n= 𝐼(𝜏, 𝛺) −\n𝜔0\n4𝜋∫\n𝐼(𝜏, 𝛺′)𝑃(𝛺, 𝛺′)\n \n4𝜋\n𝑑𝛺′ −\n𝜔0\n4𝜋𝐸0𝑃(𝛺, −𝛺0)exp (−\n𝜏\n𝜇0).    (11) \nSolving this equation, the top of the atmosphere radiance (𝐿𝑠𝑎𝑡\n∗\n)  can be computed assuming \ntropical atmosphere in the range of 0.4-1.0 𝜇𝑚 at the spectral resolution of 0.0025𝜇𝑚, which \nare then convoluted to OCM-2 spectral response functions to simulate observations. The \nradiative scattering due to aerosols is simulated assuming 2 fine aerosol models defined as \nmoderately and strongly absorbing aerosols, and 1 coarse aerosol model named dust aerosol \nmodel. The optical properties (extinction and scattering coefficients, single scattering albedo, \nphase function, and asymmetry factor) of the basic modes (accumulation and coarse modes) are \ncomputed from the Mie theory assuming multi-modal log-normal distribution defined by \n𝑛(𝑟) = ∑\n𝑖=1\n𝑁\n𝑓𝑖\n𝑟𝑙𝑛𝜎𝑖𝑒𝑥𝑝[\n𝑙𝑛2𝑟/𝑟𝑚,𝑖\n2𝑙𝑛2𝜎𝑖],            \n \n \n \n \n             (12) \nwhere 𝑁 is the number of modes, 𝑟 is the particle radius, 𝑟𝑚,𝑖 is the mean radius of mode 𝑖, 𝜎𝑖 \nis the width of mode 𝑖, and 𝑓𝑖 is the number density of mode 𝑖. These parameters and the \nrefractive index (𝑚𝑖= 𝑚𝑖,𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙+ 𝑚𝑖,𝑖𝑚𝑔) for each mode used in Mie calculations are taken from \nLevy et al., 2007. An exponential profile of AOD with a scaled height of 2 km is assumed. In \nthe current version of the algorithm, to reduce the computational time of operational retrieval \nof AOD, RT simulation-based look-up-tables (LUTs) are generated and saved as the auxiliary \ndatabase, which is used to calculate the 𝜌𝑠𝑎𝑡\n∗ as a function of solar zenith 𝜃𝑜, sensor zenith 𝜃, \nrelative azimuth angle Δ𝜙, 𝜌𝑠 and AOD (varied from 0-5). LUTs corresponding to 𝐴𝑂𝐷=\n0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 2, 3.0, 5.0 for each spectral band are generated and saved. Each LUT \ncontains calculated path reflectance for ten 𝜃𝑜 and 𝜃  values ranging from 0.0 to 72.0 with an \ninterval of 6.0 degrees and for sixteen Δ𝜙 values ranging from 0.0 to 180.0 with an interval of \n12 degrees. For RT simulation several ready-to-use codes are freely available, however, in the \ncurrent version of the algorithm, the discrete ordinate method is used for which CDISORT code \nis customized as per the need. \n \n \n18 \n \n4.3.5 Aerosol inversion \nThe radiance data for two blue channels (443 and 490 nm in the case of OCM-2) are then \ncompared with modelled radiance. A maximum likelihood method is used to match the \nappropriate values of aerosol optical thickness at 550nm and mixing ratio to the measured \nradiance. For estimating the best solution, first AOD solutions using different aerosol models \n(represented by 12 values of fine mode fraction ranging from -0.1 to 1.1) is estimated by \nfinding the perfect match between modelled and observed radiance in band-3 (490 nm), \nsecondly among these best AOD solutions one is chosen as the final solution by comparing \nmodelled and measured radiance in band-2 (443nm). The technique thus derived gives a \nprocedure, which is performed on each cloud-free land pixel, giving one of the finest daily \naerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550nm and fine mode fraction. Mathematically for each pixel, \na set of AOD and fine mode fraction is found for which the equations (13) and (14) are \nsatisfied. \n𝜌490\n∗\n− 𝜌490\n𝑇𝑂𝐴= 0,                                                                                          (13) \n𝜌443\n∗\n− 𝜌443\n𝑇𝑂𝐴= 𝜀𝑚𝑖𝑛.

AERONEt (Aerosol Robotic Network) is a network of ground-based sun \nphotometers established and maintained by Brent Holben of Code 923 of the NASA Goddard \nSpace Flight Center and Tom Eck of Raytheon ITSS. The sun-photometers measure the spectral \naerosol optical thickness and sky radiance. In India 4 AERONET sites namely Jaipur, Kanpur, \nGandhi College, and Amity University Noida; in Bangladesh 2 sites namely Bhola and Dhaka \nUniversity; in Pakistan Lahore and Karachi, and few sites in Nepal and Myanmar are providing \nsystematic in-situ AOD measurements. Data from these sites will be used for validation of \nOCM-2 derived AODs after proper co-location in space and time.  \nFor co-location of AERONET data with OCM-2 AOD retrievals, the in-situ AOD measurements \nwill be averaged in a ±30 minute window centered at the time of OCM-2 AOD retrievals. It is \nto be noted that different AERONET stations may have a different temporal resolution of the \nin-situ measurement, therefore, along with overall validation, the variation in validation \nresults when using in-situ data at different temporal resolution will also be studied. \n6.2.2 Handheld sun photometer validation \nMany of the present satellite observations are augmented by special field campaigns to \nprovide ground-truth data for the satellite-derived measurements. Ongoing and Past data \nfrom such campaigns will be sued for validation. \n6.2.3 Satellite-based Inter-comparisons \nOCM-2 derived AOD may be validated by comparing them with aerosol optical depths derived \nby other satellite sensors, such as MODIS/VIIRS. The basic inter-comparison technique \ninvolves three steps: 1) Identification of locations where both sensors fly over at nearly the \nsame time; 2) Extraction of data for storage in an inter-comparison archive; 3) Analysis of the \ndifferences between the measurements. \n6.3 Provisional validation \n6.3.1 Derived AOD maps \nFigures 6, 7, and 8 display the ability of the developed aerosol product to capture different \nsources of aerosols such as small to large-scale forest fires, dust storms, and anthropogenic \nactivities over different parts of India. Due to high-resolution data (figure 6) it is evident that \n22 \n \nthe spatial distribution of aerosol over megacities such as Delhi can be monitored using the \nOCM-2 AOD product. The availability of high-resolution spatial distribution of aerosol from \nspace over megacities will play a major role in developing a product such as ground particulate \nmatter (PM2.5 and PM10) maps at a large scale, which will be helpful in monitoring of air-\nquality and developing mitigation techniques in metropolitan cities. \nIn figure 8, the AOD map, fine mode fraction map, and AOD histogram are shown for data \nacquired by OCM-2 over eastern Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP) and central India on 15 January \n2021. The particle size distribution function from AERONET data at Bhola station, Bangladesh \nis also shown in figure 8 for the same date. A very thick layer of aerosol (heavy air pollution, \nAOD>1.0) over IGP is observed. The AERONET stations located at Dhaka University and Bhola, \nBangladesh show very high AOD values of 1.5 and 1.25, respectively. OCM-2 AOD retrieval is \nconsistent with ground observations. A fine mode fraction map shows high fine aerosols in \nthe entire IGP, while relatively coarser-sized particles in central India are observed. It is well \nknown that during winter’s high anthropogenic pollution associated with the biomass/biofuel \ncombustion process occurs over IGP giving rise to fine aerosols. The dominance of fine mode \naerosol is also verified by size distribution observations at AERONET stations Dhaka University \nand Bhola.  \n6.3.2 Validation results with AERONET data \nAs described previously the retrieved products must look reasonable, and must be evaluated \nabout ground-truth data. The test data includes the entire 2016 data i.e., almost around 1092 \nL1B datasets were processed to generate the aerosol product. Out of these 180 individual \ngranules corresponding to path-9, row-13 (during the entire year of 2016) enclosing four \nAERONET stations namely Kanpur, Jaipur, Gual Pahari (India), and Karachi (Pakistan) are used \nfor validation with ground truth.   Among these, 3 stations, are interior urban centers and \nmainly affected by anthropogenic sources of aerosols. Over Karachi, being a coastal city, the \naerosols are also affected by marine sources (sea salt) in addition to anthropogenic sources. \nThe results are shown in figure 9. A very good correlation, of around 0.8 is observed. About \n63% to 80% of AOD retrievals are within the error envelope (EE) of 20%. The results show that \nthe proposed algorithm is highly sensitive towards aerosol retrieval using VNIR observation \nfrom the OCM-2 sensor.   A slight deviation of the slope of the regression line may be due to \nseveral reasons but most probably it is due to calibration error, deviation of aerosol optical \nproperties used for inversion, and/or due to uncertainty in surface characterization in the \nvisible channel. These factors need to be improved in future versions. \n23 \n \n \nFigure 6. AOD map on 2 November 2016.

Validation results of the OCM-2 AOD using AERONET in-situ AOD at different stations. \n \n7.0 Technical issues (Limitations etc.) \n \nThe aerosol retrieval may fail at very bright surfaces due to physical limitations or due to the \nsaturation of data. For very bright surfaces after a certain value of aerosol optical depth, the \nmodel radiance becomes highly inaccurate.  \n \nIn the current version of the algorithm, the fine mode fraction values are used at discrete \nlevels therefore fine mode maps may show pixelated appearance.  \n \nValidation of the fine mode fraction is difficult as no in-situ observations are available, \nhowever, in the future fine mode AOD (FAOD) may be correlated with AERONET inverted \nFAOD values. \n \nUsing OCM-2 channels it is not possible to identify snowy pixels, therefore though snow pixels \nare expected to be masked as cloudy pixels due to high reflectance but still partially snow \ncontaminated or less reflecting snow pixels may so unexpected AOD retrieved values. In \n26 \n \nfuture versions, AWIFS based snow climatology can be used for the identification of snowy \npixels. \n \nFor AOD retrievals the OCM-2 radiance image is down-sampled by the average filter of 3 x 3-\npixel size to improve the signal-to-noise ratio required for AOD retrieval. If retrieval is \nperformed at the original resolution the uncertainty may reach above the targeted \nuncertainty of <20%.  \n \nIt is to be noted the aerosol retrieval is very sensitive to the radiance calibration as well as to \nsurface reflectance. An error of 1% sensor measured reflectance or in surface reflectance may \nlead to an uncertainty of 10% in AOD retrievals.  \n \n8.0 Future scope \n \nThe current algorithm will be extended to derive AOD at other spectral wavelengths also. \n \nCloud contamination in AOD retrievals at the edges of the clouds may be improved by \ndeveloping a better cloud mask based on spectral analysis. \n \nIn the current version of the algorithm, the vegetation index is used to know the surface type \nfor surface characterization from visible bands; however, pseudo-albedo may also be a \npotential variable for the same purpose.  \n \n A similar algorithm can be adapted for OCM-3 on-board upcoming OceanSat-3.  \n \nKnowing AOD, the aerosol correction on level-1 data can be performed for generating surface \nreflectance and various land products such as surface NDVI.  \n \nSince OCM-2 AOD retrieval is at a very high spatial resolution of 0.7 km, therefore these can \nbe used for atmospheric correction of AWIFS data which will make AWIFS data more useful \nfor agriculture and other land-use applications. \n \nIn the current version, the aerosol model is taken from the work done by Levy et al, 2007 \nabout one decade ago based on global in-situ data from AERONET. However, there is a need \nfor reanalysis/updating of aerosol types over different parts of the world, especially over \ncountries like India with complex atmosphere. This will improve the aerosol retrieval accuracy \nand will also help in establishing the fine-mode fraction as a quantitative indicator instead of \nthe qualitative indicator for anthropogenic aerosol sources. \n \nThis product is expected to cater inputs for radiative effects of aerosols and air-quality \nmonitoring. \n \n9.0 Discussion \nIn the present document, we introduced a new algorithm for deriving aerosol properties over land \nfrom OCM-2 Level 1B spectral radiance. The beta version of the OCM-2 aerosol product generated \nusing this algorithm is operational from 17 December 2020. Unlike other algorithms, this method \ndoes not need SWIR channel observation, moreover, it does not assume near Infrared channels \n27 \n \ntransparent to aerosols. In fact, in addition to visible channels, it uses aerosol information \ncontained in near Infrared channels also. The OCM-2 aerosol algorithm is tested subjectively as \nwell as on several test datasets. The results are evaluated at co-located AERONET sites. In its \nprovisional validation, OCM-2 AOD retrievals perform well. On average nearly 70% of AOD \nretrievals found within an uncertainty envelope of 20% with a correlation coefficient r = 0.83. \nRetrievals of fine mode fraction are found to agree with a general understanding of aerosol \nsources in India and to some extent have been seen correlated with an AERONET size distribution, \nbut quantitatively have not been validated and therefore results should not be considered to be \nquantitative. We note that the validation of fine mode AOD will be done in near future, which will \nbe a product that can be related to the anthropogenic contribution to the total aerosol optical \ndepth. The provisional validation suggests that the operational beta version retrieval is capable of \nderiving AOD over land within expected uncertainty. However, it is necessary to perform extensive \nvalidation exercises including more ground truth sites with more OCM-2 data. \nAs already discussed in the introductory section the primary objective of developing this algorithm \nis intended to cater inputs for radiative and air-quality studies over the Indian landmass. However, \nwith this aerosol product, OCM-2 data utilization can be extended to other land applications also, \nwhich was to date limited to ocean Colour applications only. Just as part of this discussion and to \nappreciate the utility of OCM aerosol product for other land applications, we have shown OCM-2 \nNDVI product derived with and without aerosol correction in figure 9. The drastic improvement \napparent in NDVI establishes the possible utility of this AOD product in many other land \napplications in addition to radiative and air-quality related studies. \n \nFigure 10.

INTRODUCTION:  Satellite measurements of ocean colour allow synoptic \ncoverage of ocean biological production on a global scale. Satellite derived \nchlorophyll measurements provide global distribution of phytoplankton CHL-\na on high spatial and temporal scale. The accurate measurements of ocean \nchlorophyll concentration are very critical to understand the regional and \nglobal impact of climate change on marine ecosystem. Considering the \ncontribution of chlorophyll-a measurements to the characterization of Earth’s \nclimate, World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has identified CHL-a as \none of the Essential Climate Variable (ECV) under ocean category. However, \nthe continuous availability of satellite based CHL-a is a major challenge due \nto the obstruction of the visible part of the e.m spectrum by clouds. Moreover, \nthe observations from ocean colour near coastal region suffer from inaccurate \natmospheric correction due to the optical complexity in the coastal waters. \nCoupled physical-biogeochemical modelling provides a key insight into the \ninteraction of elements in the physical and biogeochemical system of marine \necosystem. The coupled models, thus become an essential tool in the scientific \ncommunity to elucidate the mechanism of physical and marine system and \npredict its evolution in both space and time scale.  It enhanced the scope to \nstudy the biogeochemical and ecological responses to physical forcing, which \nis a key component in the climate change science and environmental risk \nassessment.  \n2.1 Overview and Background: The synergistic use of satellite derived \nchlorophyll and model simulated chlorophyll is adapted in order to explore the \nadvantages offered by both systems in the generation of analysed fields of \nchlorophyll. For this purpose, daily fields of model chlorophyll from a coupled \nphysical-biogeochemical model are modified with respect to satellite derived \nchlorophyll data by statistically combining both fields of chlorophyll using \nParticle filter technique for the global ocean. Particle Filter is an ensemble \nbased technique like ensemble Kalman filter (van Leeuwen, 2009). But unlike \nmethods like EnKF, ensemble optimal interpolation (Evensen, 2003) etc, \nparticle filter doesn’t change the dynamical balance of the system and also does \nnot consider the apriori assumption of the Gaussianity of the probability \ndistribution function (PDF) of the system. This makes particle filter more \nsuitable for non-linear systems like ocean dynamics. Recently the particle filter \ntechniques have been successfully utilized in assimilation of chlorophyll data \nin a coupled bio-physical model (Ratheesh et al., 2016) and in the assimilation \nof highly non-linear coastal waves in a wave models (Bhowmick et al., 2019). \n2.2 Objective  \nThe main objective of this document is to provide step wise implementation of \nthe algorithm, along with required inputs and desired outputs. This document \nwill form the basis of operational implementation of the algorithm. \n2.3 Input data sets \n2.3.1 Satellite Data: Chlorophyll-a global product from OCM3 onboard \nOCEANSAT-3 is used in the algorithm to improve model simulations of \nchlorophyll. GAC products are available scene wise at 1 km resolution wise \n(https://bhoonidhi.nrsc.gov.in). More than 200 scenes are available daily for \nthe entire globe. Therefore, a gridded field of OCM-3 chlorophyll-a is \ngenerated as an intermediate product for the global ocean at 4km resolution \ncombining all the OCM-3 products available for the particular day. \n2.3.2 Model Data: Chlorophyll from coupled physical-biogeochemical model \n(MOM5-TOPAZ) for the global ocean is used as the background chlorophyll \nfield in the algorithm. This model is operationally running at SAC. \n2.3.2.1 General description of the Ocean General Circulation Model \nOcean General circulation model used for the simulation of physical \nparameters of ocean is Modular Ocean Model, version 5 (MOM-5).  It is a \nnumerical representation of the ocean’s hydrostatic primitive equations \nemploying either Boussinesq (volume conserving) or non-Boussinesq (mass \nconserving) kinematics. The present study use Boussinesq kinematics. This \nmodel is developed by NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory \n(GFDL) in Princeton, USA.  The horizontal grids used in MOM5 are \ngeneralized horizontal coordinates, with the coordinates assumed to be locally \northogonal. For global ocean climate modeling, MOM uses the tripolar grid \nthat has a bipolar Arctic region (Murray , 1996). The model also employs a \nsplit-explicit time stepping scheme where fast two-dimensional dynamics is \nsub-cycled within the slower three dimensional dynamics. MOM gives a wide \narray of vertical mixing schemes and the present model configuration used \nKPP scheme.  \n2.3.2.2. Description of the Ecosystem model \nThe present configuration for global ocean is a coupled one, in which MOM5, \nthe ocean component is coupled to an ocean ecosystem model. A \ncomprehensive model of oceanic ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles is \nused to understand and simulate the ocean ecosystem. The model used is \nTracers Of Phytoplankton and Allometric Zooplankton (TOPAZ). TOPAZ is \na state of the art model that considers 22 tracers including three phytoplankton \ngroups, two forms of dissolved organic matter, heterotrophic biomass, and \ndissolved inorganic species for C, N, P, Si, Fe, CaCO3 and O2 cycling. The \nmodel includes such processes as gas exchange, atmospheric deposition, \nscavenging, N2 ﬁxation and water column and sediment denitriﬁcation, and \nrunoﬀ of C, N, Fe, O2, alkalinity and lithogenic material. The phytoplankton \nfunctional groups undergo co-limitation by light, nitrogen, phosphorus and \niron with ﬂexible physiology. Loss of phytoplankton is parameterized through \nthe size-based relationship of Dunne et al. (2012b). Particle export is described \nthrough size and temperature based detritus formation and mineral protection \nduring sinking with a mechanistic, solubility-based representation alkalinity \naddition from rivers, CaCO3 sedimentation and sediment preservation and \ndissolution. \nFor each model state variable C , the continuity equation is solved \n𝜕𝐶\n𝜕𝑡= −∇. 𝑢̃𝐶+ ∇𝐾∇𝑐+ 𝑆𝐶 \nWhere 𝑢̃ is the velocity vector from the OGCM ,  𝐾 is the diffusivity, and 𝑆𝐶 \nis the sum of the sources and sinks for state variable C. \n2.3.2.3 Coupled biogeochemical - physical model (MOM5-TOPAZ) \nThe coupled biogeochemical - physical model is configured for global ocean \nwith a horizontal resolution of 25 km and a variable vertical resolution with a \nvery fine near surface and coarser towards the bottom of ocean. There are 50 \nlevels in the vertical direction. The external time step used is 22.5 sec and the \ninternal time step used is 1800 sec. The model bottom topography is derived \nfrom the 2 minute resolution ETOPO 2 database. The surface salt is restored \nto climatology on a time scale of 2 months. \nDuring spin up, the physical model was forced by climatological wind and flux \ndata sets and was initialized with temperature and salinity data from Levitus. \nThe model was spun up for 50 years from rest.  Afterwards, TOPAZ model is \ncoupled with the physical model and performed a climatology run for another \n10 years. For this nitrate, phosphate and silicate are initialised using data from \nWOA13. After this, an inter-annual run is performed using the daily forcing \nfields of wind, net short and long wave radiation, precipitation, air temperature \nand specific humidity from NCMRWF from 2018 onwards. Model forecast is \nalso performed using the NCMRWF data sets for the next 8 days. Model \nforecasts are written for every six hours, while the analysis fields are written \ndaily. \n2.3.3 Other Auxiliary data: None \nTable 1: Input data sets for the algorithm \nData sets \nSpatial Resolution \nTemporal \nResolution \nChlorophyll \nfrom \ncoupled model \n25 km x 25 km \nDaily \nChlorophyll \nfrom \nOCM-3 \n(GAC \nproduct) \n1 km  \nDaily \n \n3. Algorithm Functional Specifications \n In this section we describe the theoretical basis and algorithm overview for generating \ndaily analysed fields of ocean surface chlorophyll for the global ocean.  \n3.1. Overview \nOCM-3 derived chlorophyll products are assimilated into the coupled model using particle \nfilter technique to generate more improved fields of model chlorophyll state. Bootstrap \ntechnique is used to generate particles/ensembles from model background field, which is \nchlorophyll field at ocean surface.  A gridded field of OCM3 derived chlorophyll fields at \n4 km is generated daily for the global ocean as an intermediate product. These three major \nsteps in the algorithm are shown in Figure 1.  \n \n \nFigure 1: Major steps involved in the generation of analysed chlorophyll product \n \n \n3.2. Generation of 4km gridded fields of OCM-3 derived Chlorophyll (Intermediate \nproduct): GAC products of chlorophyll for the global ocean are available scene wise \nand includes many number of GAC data products for a single day. Therefore, an \nintermediate product of OCM-3 chlorophyll is generated daily for the global ocean at \n4 km resolution. For the purpose, firstly a background data with 4 km pixel resolution \nis generated for the global ocean. Secondly, each of the GAC products are scanned \nlocation wise and corresponding chlorophyll value is allotted to the specific 4 km pixel \ncorresponding to the location. Figure 2 shows flowchart of generating the gridded \nfields of OCM-3 chlorophyll for the global ocean. For an example, the gridded OCM-\n3 derived chlorophyll for the global ocean is shown for 28 November 2023. More than \n200 GAC scenes were considered to generate gridded OCM-3 product for the \nmentioned day. \n \nFigure 2: Flowchart of gridded 4 km OCM-3 chlorophyll data for the global ocean. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3: Gridded 4 km OCM-3 derived Chlorophyll for the global ocean for 28 \nNovember 2023.

Theoretical Background of Particle Filter technique \nThe algorithm used for the assimilation of satellite derived CHL into the coupled \nmodel is a state of the art ensemble based particle filter technique. Particle filtering \nuses a set of particles to represent the posterior distribution of a stochastic process \ngiven noisy and/or partial observations. The novelty of the scheme lies in the fact \nthat, unlike other ensemble technique, particle filter does not impose any \nrestriction on the form of the PDF of the background field. Thus, its superiority in \nnonlinear and non-Gaussian systems makes it widely acceptable to many \napplications (van Leeuwen, 2009, 2010).  The realistic implementation of Particle \nfilter is explained in Mattern et al., 2013; Ratheesh et al., 2016 and Bhowmick et \nal 2019.  \nParticle filtering method approximate the posterior distribution using \nrandomly extracted particle sets from the posterior probability. The central \nconcept is to determine the distribution of the system’s state variable with \nminimal variability or uncertainty, and is achieved by updating the \nprobability distribution of the state variable based on observed data and \nsystem dynamics. The cornerstone of particle filter is Bayes’s theorem which \nreads  \n𝑝𝑚(𝜓|𝑑) =\n𝑝𝑑(𝑑|𝜓)𝑝𝑚(𝜓)\n𝑝𝑑(𝑑)\n                      \n \n \n \n(1) \nWhere: \n1. 𝑝𝑚(𝜓|𝑑) is the Posterior distribution, representing the true state of the \nsystem generated using model simulated chlorophyll (𝜓) given chlorophyll  \nobservations (𝑑) from OCM-3. \n2. 𝑝𝑑(𝑑|𝜓) is the likelihood function, representing the probability of \nobserving 𝑑 given  the prior information about the state of the system, \nwhich is the model simulated chlorophyll. This term plays a crucial role in \nassigning weights to the model particles based on their consistency with \nthe observed data.  \n3. 𝑝𝑚(𝜓) is the prior information about the ocean surface chlorophyll, also \nknown as background fields. These are obtained from coupled model \nsimulations of chlorophyll. A set of randomly selected model particles \nrepresent the Probability Distribution Function (PDF) of the background \nfields.  \nThe model PDF can be written as  \np(ψ) = \n1\n𝑁∑\n𝛿(𝜓−𝜓𝑖)\n𝑁\n𝑖=1\n                                                     (2) \nwhere, N is the number of particles.  𝜓𝑖 is spanning the range from 1 to N. \nThe term 𝛿(𝜓−𝜓𝑖) represents the PDF of an individual particle centered \naround its value  𝜓𝑖, where 𝛿 is the Dirac delta function. The number of \nparticles in the study N is 250. \n4. 𝑝𝑑(𝑑) is the probability of observations. Its computation can be \nchallenging, particularly in scenarios with sparse observations. This \nprobability is not directly computed but is implicitly represented by the \nsum of weights of particles (𝑤𝑖). These weights, assigned to each particle \nbased on its likelihood of matching the observations, collectively form a \nprobability distribution. Normalizing the weights ensures that they sum \nup to one, effectively representing the likelihood of observing 𝑑 across all \nparticles. Thus, the 𝑝𝑑(𝑑) can be written as: \n𝑝𝑑(𝑑) = ∑\n𝑤𝑖\n𝑁\n𝑖=1\n                    (3) \nwhere 𝑤𝑖 is the weight of each particle computed with respect to the \nobservations.  \nThe computation of weights is a crucial step in the particle filter technique \nand is represented by: \n                                                 \n𝑤𝑖=\n𝑝(𝑑|𝜓𝑖)\n∑\n𝑝(𝑑|𝜓𝑖)\n𝑁\n𝑖=1\n  \n \n \n \n \n(4) \nTherefore, 𝑤𝑖 represents the likelihood of observing 𝑑 given each particle \n𝜓𝑖 compared to the total likelihood of observing 𝑑 across all particles. As \nmentioned earlier, weights are already normalized so that their sum is unity. \nWeight is inversely proportional to the distance between a given observation \nand its model background. The distance is taken to be usual root mean square \ndifference between model chlorophyll and OCM-3 derived chlorophyll, \ntaken over those model grids where observations are available on a particular \nday. Thus, the particles close to observation receive more weight as \ncompared to farther ones. In this study, model particles of chlorophyll close \nto OCM-3 derived chlorophyll assign large weightage and becomes strong \nparticles, while weak particles are discarded. The posterior distribution is \nthen represented by the set of particles with stronger weights. These particles, \nwith higher weights, are considered to be more likely to represent the true \nstate of the system based on the available observations. \n \n3.4. Particle filter and its implementation procedure  \nOne critical aspect of the ensemble-based approach in high-dimensional \ncoupled models is the generation of a large number of ensembles or particles \nneeded to closely approximate the posterior probability density of the system. \nParticle generation in this study is done using bootstrapping sampling by \nintroducing random biases to the background field (Bhowmick et al 2019). \nThis approach substantially reduces the computational time required for \nparticle generation, which otherwise needs a distinct model run for each \nparticle generation in the conventional particle filter techniques. The random \nGaussian biases are computed with zero mean and 0.5 mg/m3 standard \ndeviation. Here, we used standard deviation of the model chlorophyll to \ndefine the PDF of random biases. The randomly introduced biases are then \nmodified for each model grid point with respect to both the model \nchlorophyll values at each grid point and the model bias. In this way, the \ncorrection term added to the model chlorophyll varies spatially with respect \nto the values of chlorophyll at that grid location. Model bias is computed \nfrom the long-term model simulations with respect to satellite-derived \nchlorophyll and its value is 0.3 mg/m3. This method results in a total of 250 \nparticles being drawn by introducing biases to the background field. \nAnother important step in the Particle Filter technique is the selection of \nstrong particles to represent Posterior PDF. This is done using a sequential \nimportance resampling (SIR) method (van Leeuwen 2009, Bhowmick et al., \n2019, Bhowmick et. al. 2023) to ensure robust estimation of the posterior \ndistribution. The basic idea is to discard particles with low weights and retain \nmultiple copies of particles with relatively higher weights, keeping the total \nnumber of particles the same. Selection of particles based on its weight is \ncarried out using Sequential Importance Resampling (SIR) method. In this \nmethod, weights are first normalised ([0 1)] and then added to form a \ncumulative distribution. A random generator is used to generate random \nnumbers and the weights close to this random number is selected from \ncumulative distribution and this process is repeated multiple times. \nProbability is very high for choosing particles with higher weight from a \ncumulative distribution. Thus, the weights for each particle are computed, \nand the particles are resampled, assigning them equal weights (1/N). N is the \ntotal number of ensembles generated. This weight calculation and resampling \nprocess is how observations are assimilated into the model. Particle \ndegeneracy is a common problem associated with ensemble-based \ntechniques, where a very few particles carry significant weights, while the \nmajority have negligible weights. This leads to a loss of diversity in the \nparticle population and inaccurate representation of the posterior distribution. \nSIR addresses this issue by retaining the multiple copies of stronger particles \nand ensuring that the particle population remains diverse during the \nresampling process, where particles are randomly selected based on their \nweights. Assigning equal weights to all selected particles during resampling \nensures that each particle has an equal chance of being selected. This \nprevents the loss of valuable information and improves the sampling \nefficiency and robustness of the sampling variability.  \nThe flowchart of generating analysed chlorophyll fields for the global ocean \nis given in Figure 4. \n \nFigure 4 : Flow chart of the methodology for generating analysed \nchlorophyll fields \n \n3.5. Operational Implementation: The implementation steps that are to be followed are \nmentioned below and is also shown in Figure 5. \nStep 1: Daily fields of ocean surface chlorophyll output generated from MOM5-\nTOPAZ coupled model in MOSDAC is considered as the model background data. \nStep 2: OCM-3 GAC chlorophyll data downloaded from Bhunidhi NRSC site is \nconsidered as the observation. \nStep 3: Checking the availability of model and OCM-3 data. If both data sets are \navailable, following steps (steps 4 – 6) will be carried out to generate final product of \nanalysed chlorophyll field. \nStep 4: Generation of daily gridded fields of OCM-3 Chlorophyll combining all GAC \nproducts for the particular day. \nStep 5: Preparation of 250 ensembles from model background field using Bootstrap \ntechnique. \nStep 6: Generation of daily analysed fields of chlorophyll for the global ocean using \nParticle Filter technique. \n \n \nFigure 5: Steps involved in the Operational Implementation  \n \n3.6 Output: Daily fields of chlorophyll from coupled model is improved using particle \nfilter technique incorporating OCM-3 derived chlorophyll data. Therefore, the output \ngenerated is available at the same temporal and spatial resolution of the coupled model, \nwhich is at 25 km spatial resolution and daily. \n3.6.1. Format of Output : The outputs are available as images (jpeg format)  and \nproduct file (nc format). The analysed chlorophyll fields displayed in the Gallery \nsection in the MOSDAC is shown in Figure 6 for the day 25 January 2024. \n \n \n \nFigure 6. A typical standard output available in MOSDAC Gallery section \n3.7 Initial Validation  \nFor inter-comparison and validation, independent observations of satellite and Bio-\nArgo buoys are used for the period September 2023 to November 2023.   \n3.7.1 Analysis with Multi-Satellite Chlorophyll data  \nFor validating the analysed products, results are compared with available \nsatellite observations. For the purpose, we have used chlorophyll data from \nsensors other than OCM-3 such as MODIS, VIIRS, etc. This validation can \nbe considered as an independent validation as these satellite information is \nnot incorporated while generating the analysed chlorophyll product. A \nmerged product of chlorophyll from these satellites are downloaded from \nhttps://marine.copernicus.eu. \nTo generate analysed chlorophyll fields, OCM-3 derived chlorophyll is \nassimilated to the coupled model simulated chlorophyll to improve the model \nsimulations of surface chlorophyll. Therefore, validation is carried to check \nthe improvement brought to the model simulations through the incorporation \nof OCM-3 data. Figure 7 shows the weekly average of chlorophyll (15 Oct \n2023 to 22 Oct 2023) from various sources; 1) Coupled model chlorophyll, \n2) Analysed Chlorophyll, 3) Chlorophyll from OCM-3, and 4) Merged \nChlorophyll data from multi-satellites.  It is clear from Figure 7 that analysed \nchlorophyll fields capture the chlorophyll features in the ocean as observed \nin the multi satellite data. However, a slight overestimation is observed in the \nanalysed products towards polar region beyond 60o latitude in both the \nhemispheres and is partially attributed to the sparse observations of OCM-3 \nin those regions and the bootstrapping sampling used in the study. While \nsampling, all the model points are altered adding random biases to the \nbackground filed. These particles are then compared with OCM-3 \nchlorophyll data to select strong particles as mentioned in the methodology \nsection. Therefore, quantity and quality of OCM-3 observations play crucial \nrole in the generation of more accurate analysed fields of chlorophyll. OCM-\n3 shows a positive bias all over the ocean with respect to multi-satellite \nchlorophyll data. \n \nFigure 7: Chlorophyll from various sources averaged over the period 15 Oct \nto 22 Oct 2023. a) Coupled model chlorophyll, (b) Analysed Chlorophyll, c) \nOCM-3 derived Chlorophyll, and d) Merged product from multi satellites. \nFigures 8 and 9 show mean and standard deviation of chlorophyll from \ndifferent sources. It is very vivid from the figures that assimilation of OCM-\n3 data improved model simulations of chlorophyll. Analysed fields of \nchlorophyll is more close to chlorophyll observations from multi-satellite as \ncompared to model simulations of chlorophyll and OCM-3 derived \nchlorophyll.  The features of wind-driven upwelling induced chlorophyll \nconcentrations in the western Arabian are enhanced in the analysed \nchlorophyll fields due to OCM-3 integration compared to chlorophyll \nsimulations from coupled model without OCM-3 data. \n \nFigure 8: Mean of the ocean surface chlorophyll:  a) Coupled model \nchlorophyll, b) Analysed Chlorophyll, c) OCM-3 derived Chlorophyll, and \nd) Chlorophyll from multi satellites.  \n \nFigure 9: Standard deviation of the ocean surface chlorophyll: a) Coupled \nmodel chlorophyll, b) Analysed Chlorophyll, c) OCM-3 derived Chlorophyll, \nand d) Chlorophyll from multi satellites \n3.7.2 Comparison with Bio-Argo data \nIndependent validation of the analysed chlorophyll and merged chlorophyll \nfrom multi-satellites has been conducted using Bio-Argo measurements. Bio-\nArgo is an extension of the Argo program, incorporating biogeochemical \nobservations, including chlorophyll-a concentration, oxygen concentration, \npH, and more. These floats are deployed and managed by an international \ncommunity in coordination with institutes from various countries (Wong et \nal., 2020). Bio-Argo floats are downloaded from htttps://biogeochmical-\nargo.org.  \nFigure 10 shows the buoy locations used for the comparison. Multi-satellites \nchlorophyll, Analysed Chlorophyll, and model simulated chlorophyll \nwithout OCM-3 are compared with buoy measured chlorophyll and the \nstatics are shown in the Table 1. Percentage error is computed using the \nequation \n𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸 𝑜𝑓 𝐶𝐻𝐿\n𝐵𝑖𝑜−𝐴𝑟𝑔𝑜 𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛 𝐶𝐻𝐿 ∗100.  \nRMSE is found less for the analysed chlorophyll compared to multi-satellite \nderived chlorophyll when compared against Bio-Argo data. One added \nadvantage in the Analysed chlorophyll is the availability of data at all ocean \npoints. Another reason is that collocated points are less in the case of multi-\nsatellite data and is owing to the data void due to cloud obstruction. This \nissue does not affect analysed chlorophyll data as it is generated by \ncombining chlorophyll observation with model simulation, providing \nchlorophyll at all model grid points. Additionally, analysed chlorophyll has \nthe advantage of model simulations and observations and it’s the errors are \nless compared to other two individual components such as model simulations \nand observations. Analysed chlorophyll OCF data exhibits a positive bias of \n0.24 mg/m3 and is partially attributed to the positive bias in OCM-3 \nchlorophyll observations.  Among the three CHL datasets, analysed CHL \nshows a lower percentage error, indicating better performance.  \n \nFigure 10.

Additionally, the model is not currently \nforward-integrated with the improved initial conditions of chlorophyll. \n4.1 Future Aspect: The algorithm used here is to generate analysed ocean surface \nchlorophyll. A fully fledged data assimilation scheme, which sequentially incorporates the \nmodified model fields into the model future projections is planned as future work. The \npossibility of assimilating Bio-Argo measured chlorophyll and the use of the optimal \nInterpolation technique to generate analysed chlorophyll fields for the global ocean will \nalso be explored. \n4.2 Potential Users of the data: One of the highlight of the analysed CHL products is the \ngap-free data for the global ocean. This analysed CHL products are beneficial for studies \nrelated to biogeochemistry, PFZ, carbon export, time series analysis, distribution of \nchlorophyll in the ocean, interaction of eddies and chlorophyll, etc. Some of the expected \nend-users of this product are INCOIS, SSPU, NIO, etc \n \n \n4.

Simplest form of the algorithm is based on empirical regression, in which \nchl-a concentration is correlated with the reflectance ratio at blue and green wavelength bands (O’ \nReilly et al., 1998 & 2000). Empirical-based methods have been used operationally to generate global \nchl-a products from satellites such as Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS), SeaViewing Wide Field-of-\nView Sensor (SeaWifs), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spetroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared \nImaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and so on. Constant improvement has been made in such algorithms \nto increase their accuracy even in low chlorophyll oligotrophic waters [3]. Although reliable and easy \nto implement, retrieval from these global algorithms may not be accurate in all parts of the ocean. \nEmpirical algorithms for chl-a retrieval work on the assumption that the remote-sensing reflectance \n(Rrs) is mainly influenced by phytoplankton and its degraded products. However, this assumption does \nnot hold for Case-2 waters where the optically active constituents do not covary (Dierssen 2010). Due \nto overlapping nature of absorption spectra of various independently varying constituents, relative \nchange in reflectance value at blue and green bands cannot be linked directly to chl-a and therefore, \nresults in the failure of empirical methods. Also, during phytoplankton blooms of a particular species, \nthe empirical based method fails to accurately retrieve chla. This is because most empirical \nrelationships are derived from Case-1 waters constituting a large number of other phytoplankton \nspecies.  \nAnother set of algorithms are based on semi analytical (SA) inversions of optical closure relationship \nderived from radiative-transfer theory (Gordon et al., 1988; Carder et al., 1999; Maritorenna et al., \n2002; Lee et al., 2004). The model relates Rrs spectra to the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of a \nwater column. The IOPs include (A) total absorption coefficient, which is the sum of absorption by \nseawater (aw), phytoplankton (aph), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) + detritus (acdm); and \n(B) total backscattering coefficient, which includes backscattering by seawater (bbw) and suspended \nparticles (bbp). Proper inversion of such model allows accurate retrieval of bio-optical parameters \nincluding chl-a concentration and various IOPs.  \n \n \nFig. 1. Map of Chilika with station locations (The numbers indicate station locations where repeated \nobservations were taken in years 2014 and 2015, N = 64 points). \n \nAdvantage here is that several parameters can be retrieved simultaneously. To mathematically solve \nSA equation, spectral models for the three IOPs (i.e., aph(λ), acdm(λ), and bbp(λ)) must be known. To \ndefine spectral absorption of CDOM+detritus (CDM), exponential decay function is used which \ndepends on spectral slope “S” whereas, particle backscattering is defined in terms of a power-law \nfunction of wavelength that depends on exponent “η.” On the other hand, phytoplankton absorption \nis spectrally defined in terms of its specific absorption coefficient, which may vary based on community \nstructure and pigment composition. Therefore, complete formulation of a SA algorithm requires \ncertain model parameters to be hardcoded. However, these parameters show a nonlinear behavior \nand vary on a global scale. Accuracy of the algorithm, therefore, depends on the accuracy with which \nparameters such as specific absorption coefficient of phytoplankton (a∗ph(λ)), spectral slope “S” and \nexponent “η” are defined. If the model parameters are accurate, SA algorithm performs well even in \nCase-2 waters, where optically active constituents modify the light field independently.  \nTo use the model for any set of wavelengths, major difficulty arises in parametrization of a∗ph(λ) \n(Maritorena et al., 2002). Many researchers have expressed a∗ph(λ) as a representative spectrum for \ndoing the inversion„ whereas the coefficient is widely known for its variability. A general \nrepresentation of a∗ ph(λ) should account for its variations due to community structure shifts, pigment \ncomposition, package effect, and irradiance level (Bricaud et al., 1995; Fujiki et al., 2002). Therefore, \nthere is a need to fine-tune the existing SA algorithms in order to account for the variations in specific \nabsorption coefficient, which would allow the retrieval of bio-optical parameters (e.g., Chl-a) \nsimultaneously in both Case-1 and Case-2 waters. One of the important parameters that affects the \nretrieval of bio-optical constituents, in optically complex waters, is the slope S of acdm(λ). Meler et al. \n2016 explained the distribution of the CDM slope (S) as a function of acdm(440). It is was shown to be \nnonlinearly related to CDM absorption coefficient (Meler et al. 2016; Kowalczuk et al., 2006) and \ngoverns the spectral shape of acdm(λ). The CDM-absorption affects the attenuation of light in ultraviolet \n(UV) and blue wavelengths thereby shielding the aquatic life from harmful UV radiation (Wei et al., \n2016). In this study, we propose a SA approach with improved CDOM slope estimate for calculating \nbio-optical parameters with good accuracy in optically complex waters. \n3. \nDatasets \n3.1 NASA Bio-optical marine algorithm datasets (NOMAD) \nThe relationship between CDOM slope “S” (1/nm) and CDOM absorption coefficient ag at 443 nm \nwas established based on the combined data set of NOMAD and Indian coastal data as shown in Fig-\n3 & 4. \n3.2  Validation data set \nChilika Lagoon is a good site to study optically complex waters. Chilika lagoon on the east coast of \nIndia (19028’ N – 190 54’ N; 850 06’ E−850 35’ E) is one of the important wetlands in the country and \nis the largest brackish water lagoon in Asia. In the northern side of the lagoon, tributaries of the \nMahanadi River such as Daya, Nuna, and Bhargavi bring a lot of sediment and freshwater influx with \nterrestrial inputs into the lagoon.  \n \nFig. 2. Remote-sensing reflectance spectra (Rrs(λ)) measured during field data collection. \n \nA mouth open in the northern side of the Fig. 2. Remote-sensing reflectance spectra (Rrs(λ)) \nmeasured during field data collection. Lake exchanges seawater with Lagoon making it optically \ncomplex system. Fig. 1 shows the map of study area with station locations used for collecting in situ \ndata. Corresponding reflectance spectra is shown in Fig. 2.  \n4. \nBackground and Methodology \n4.1 Bio-Optical Inversion Model  \nGordon developed the first simplified analytical model in 1973 for ocean color applications. The \nmodel was based on the assumption that most of the scattering takes place in forward direction, \nand the color and shape of the upwelling light field are the consequences of absorption and single \nscattering at large angles (Gordon and Evans, 1993). Based on this assumption number of analytical \nmodels have been developed. The Rrs in water column is the function of total absorption coefficient \nand backscattering coefficients (Gordon et al., 1988; Morel 1988; Morel and Prieur 1977). The SA \nocean color models by Gordon et al. 1988, Maritorena et al. 2002, and Garver and Siegel 1997 are \ndescribed below through the following equations: \n𝑅𝑟𝑠(𝜆, 𝜃, 𝜓) =\n𝑡2\n𝑛𝜔\n2 ∑\n𝑔𝑖\n2\n𝑖=1\n(\n𝑏𝑏(𝜆)\n𝑏𝑏(𝜆)+𝑎(𝜆))𝑖 \n \n \n \n \n(1) \n𝑎(𝜆) = 𝑎𝜔(𝜆) + 𝑎𝑝ℎ(𝜆) + 𝑎𝑐𝑑𝑚(𝜆) \n \n \n \n \n(2) \nbb(λ) = bbw(λ) + bbp(λ)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) \n𝑎𝑝ℎ(𝜆) = 𝐶ℎ𝑙 𝑎𝑝ℎ\n∗(𝜆) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(4) \n𝑎𝑐𝑑𝑚(𝜆) = 𝑎𝑐𝑑𝑚(𝜆0)exp (−𝑆(𝜆−𝜆0)) \n \n \n \n \n(5) \n𝑏𝑏𝑝(𝜆) = 𝑏𝑏𝑝(𝜆0) [\n𝜆0\n𝜆]\n𝜂\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(6) \n4.2 Solving the Model \nThe above set of equations show that the Rrs is a function of six unknowns S, η, a∗ph(λ), chl, aCDM(λ0), \nand bbp(λ0). The vector θ = [chl, acdm(λ), bbp(λ)] represents variables to be retrieved, whereas φ = \n[a∗ph(λ1)..a∗ph(λN ), S, η] is the vector of modeled parameters. Maritorena et al. 2002 solved the bio-\noptical model [known as Garver–Seigel–Maritorena (GSM) algorithm] by minimizing the cost \nfunction described in (7). The model parameter vector (φ) was optimized from global data set using \nsimulated annealing technique. The value of vector φ in the GSM algorithm is kept constant \nthroughout the scene which may create a strong bias while solving for the unknown vector (θ), \nespecially in optically complex waters. Likewise, Lee et al. [18] proposed quasi-analytical algorithm \n(QAA) for deriving IOPs from Rrs in which he used empirical relations for estimating the parameters \nS and η [see (8) and (9). Limitation of QAA algorithm is with the parameterization of CDM slope S \n[see (8)]. The equation for S makes sense as it exploits the Rrs explicitly, but is not sufficient to deal \nwith all kinds of waters, thus affecting the retrieval outcome. In case of optically complex waters, S \ntakes much lower value for waters with high CDOM absorption at 443 nm. In addition, the presence \nof other constituents may change the slope value significantly \n \n𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡=\n1\n(𝑁𝜆−1) ∑\n[𝑅𝑟𝑠(𝜆𝑖, 𝜃, 𝜓) −𝑅𝑟𝑠(𝜆𝑖)]2\n𝑁𝜆\n𝑖=1\n \n \n \n \n(7) \n𝑆= 0.015 +\n0.002\n0.6+rrs(443)\nrrs(555)\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) \nƞ = 2.2 * (1.0 - 1.2 * exp(-0.9 * (rrs[440] / rrs[555])))                                      \n(9) \nwhere rrs is the remote sensing reflectance just below the water surface and is related to Rrs by the \nfollowing equation: \nrrs() =\nRrs() \n0.52+1.7∗Rrs()                   \n \n \n \n \n(10) \nBoth GSM and QAA uses SA model described in (1), with the two coefficient g1 and g2 fixed for nadir \nviewing geometry. Many ocean color sensors are looking at the ocean away from nadir to avoid \nsunglint making Rrs to be anisotropic in nature, having an angular distribution (Lee et al., 2004). \nTherefore, an inversion of satellite-derived reflectance with good accuracy using (1), specially for \ncoastal waters, have always been a challenging task. \n4.3 ABOM/ABOM2 Model Description \nThe basic formalism of QAA (quasi-analytical model) by Lee et al. 2004 has been adopted in analytical \nbio optical model (ABOM) model which accounts for the cumulative response of angular distribution \nof light field and multiple scattering within the water column (due to molecular or particle \nscattering) on the Rrs. The semi-ABOM, similar to GSM, solves the closure relationship between Rrs \nand IOPs using Levenberg–Marquardt technique in a least square sense. Remote-sensing reflectance \n(Rrs), as mentioned earlier, is the function of two vectors θ and φ. The unknown vector θ = [chl, \nacdm(λ), bbp(λ)] is simultaneously derived after modification in known vector φ = [a∗ ph(λ1)..a∗ \nph(λN ), S, η] parameterization. Set of equations used in ABOM model is summarized in equation 11 \nto 15. We have assumed that the absorption due to CDOM dominates over detritus absorption. We \nalso corrected for the CDOM slope bias by introducing empirically derived expression for S (Fig. 3), \ndetails are presented in Section II-D. We also accounted for the variability in a∗ph using its \ndependence on chlorophyll (Bricaud et al., 1995). This whole formulation led to a significant \nimprovement in the retrieval outcome. \n \nFig. 3.

[23] \nS = 0.016  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(17) \n4.3.1 Model for the Slope of CDOM Absorption \nThe empirical relation for CDOM slope was estimated using the extensively calibrated and enhanced \nin situ bio-optical NOMAD (NASA Bio-optical Marine algorithm data version 2.0 ALPHA) data set. \nBased on bathymetric information, all optical data corresponding to locations falling within 50-m \ndepth zone, classically defined as case-2 waters, were extracted from NOMAD. The data points from \nNOMAD were filtered on the basis of finite values of available optical parameters like water leaving \nradiance (Lw), surface solar irradiance (Es) etc., with ag available at minimum five wavelengths. Two \nchannels for ag are sufficient to estimate CDOM slope S using [20, eq. (13)]; however, more optical \nbands were added to make the filtration process robust in order to reduce the data redundancy \nwhile retaining its variability. Bio-optical data corresponding to Indian coastal waters collected under \nvarious in situ campaigns were also merged with NOMAD and the combined data set with 161 \nmeasurements were utilized for model development. Fig. 4 shows the approximate locations of \nthese data points. Slope of CDOM (S) was found to be highly variable ranging from 0.007 to 0.05 \nnm−1 for the values of reference absorption ag (443) ranging from 0.015 to 0.6 m−1. To account for \nthis variability, a power fit was performed as shown in equation (14). \n \nFig. 4. Set of data points taken from NOMAD and Indian coastal waters. \n4.4 Discussion and Validation on ABOM \nWater samples from 64 stations were collected during 2014 and 2015 in Chilika lagoon (sampling \nlocations shown in Fig. 1) and in situ chl-a were estimated using spectrophotometer. Comparison of \nchlorophyll–a concentration derived using Lee–Morel [8], [21], GSM [7], and ABOM model (this letter) \nin optically complex waters of Chilika Lagoon (see Fig. 5) indicate significant differences among the SA \nmodels when compared with in situ measurements. The mean absolute percentage difference (MAPD) \nof pooled data set for Lee–Morel and GSM was above 150% while ABOM showed significant \nimprovement in reducing the MAPD to 58%. From Table I, it is clear that mean chl-a (10.2 mg/m3) for \nABOM model is very close to mean in situ chl-a (11.05 mg/m3) unlike to Lee–Morel (27.7 mg/m3) and \nGSM (33.1 mg/m3). In addition to that, a significant improvement in the ABOM model in terms of \nrelative bias (6.92%) was observed over Lee–Morel (188.2%) and GSM (167.8%). Slope S of CDM \n(colored dissolved and detrital matter combined) used in Lee–Morel is determined dynamically based \non an empirical relationship with blue–green ratio.  \nTable-I Validation statistics \nBio-\noptical \nmodel \nRelative \nbias(%) \nBias at \nlog scale \nRMSE at \nlog scale \nMean \nchl-\na(mg/m3) \nMean insitu \nchl-a \nMAPD(%) \nLee-\nMorel \n188.2 \n0.38 \n0.45 \n27.7 \n \n11.05(mg/m3) \n189 \nGSM \n167.8 \n0.27 \n0.42 \n33.1 \n175 \nABOM \n6.92 \n-0.1 \n0.4 \n10.2 \n58 \n \n \n \nFig. 5. Validation of chl-a derived from ABOM (this study), GSM and Lee–Morel models with in situ data \nset. \nHowever, the parametrization causes the slope to be always greater than 0.015 (1/nm). In optically \ncomplex waters, the contribution of CDOM and detrital matter to absorption in blue wavelengths is \nsignificant and independent. Higher absorption in reference wavelength due to CDOM significantly \ndecreases the slope value (less than 0.01, this study). Therefore, Lee–Morel does not accurately \nestimate chlorophyll concentration when CDOM is high. In GSM model, the slope value of CDOM \nabsorption is kept constant and high (0.02 nm−1) which also creates a strong bias resulting in \noverestimation of chlorophyll concentration. The ABOM model accounts for the low magnitude in \nslope values for higher CDOM absorption in optically complex waters. Although the power function for \nCDOM slope is able to explain only 24%–25% variability in the data set, incorporation of this equation \nin ABOM is able to significantly reduce the uncertainty in the estimation of chlorophyll concentration \nwhen combined with the model for phytoplankton specific absorption [9]. The model can be further \nimproved by incorporating the contribution by detrital absorption at reference wavelength. \n4.5 Discussion and Validation on ABOM2 \nThe performance of the global models was illustrated in Table 2 for deriving absorption coefficients \ndue to coloured dissolved organic matter, detritus and their integrated response at 443nm. The \nlimitation of the Lee-Morel-Bricaud model and GSM model is to derive the integrated response of \nCDOM and detritus only with 33% and 30% uncertainty respectively. However, the above limitation \nwas partially solved using [22] i.e. the model is capable to derive the absorption coefficient due to \ncoloured dissolved organic matter at 443nm with 36% uncertainty in optically complex waters. While \nthe new parameterized model is able to address the above described limitations of deriving \nabsorption coefficients due to coloured dissolved organic matter, detritus and their integrated \nresponse at 443nm with 30%, 40% and 29% uncertainties respectively. \nIn addition to that, Statistics of the performance of the global models for deriving CDOM (ag), \ndetritus (ad) absorption coefficients and their integrated response at 443nm, have been illustrated \nin Table 3. The important point here is to note that the mean values of NASA bio optical marine \nalgorithm datasets [NOMAD] for absorption due to CDOM, detritus and their integrated response \nare 0.18 (m−1), 0.06 (m−1) and 0.24 (m−1) respectively. LMB and GSM derived integrated responses \nare 0.21 (m−1) as compared to NOMAD i.e. 0.24 (m−1) while New model derived response is very \nclose to NOMAD i.e. 0.23 (m−1). Further, new model derived individual response i.e. absorption due \nto CDOM and detritus 0.17 (m−1) and 0.06 (m−1) respectively are very close to the mean values of \nNOMAD. Similarly, Gupta et al (2020) also works very well for CDOM showing close proximity to NO- \nMAD mean CDOM at 443nm. \nThe integrated response ad+ag at 443nm is slightly underestimated with respect to NOMAD in-situ \ndata while other two models like GSM and Lee-Morel-Bricaud are overestimated with respect to \nNOMAD in-situ data as shown in Figure (6). Also, bio-optical model [22] derived only cdom (ag) at \n443nm with slope tending to unity and R-square and RMSE, 0.82 and 0.10, respectively. Whereas, \nthe new parameterized model derived cdom and detritus coefficients at 443nm, are much \nunderestimated with respect to NOMAD ag and ad at 443nm while their integrated response at \n443nm is slightly better than their individual ones. The approach adopted in the current model for \nthe isolation of detritus and CDOM absorption coefficient from remote sensing reflectance is novel \nand can be used globally. Still, there is even much more scope for their further improvements as \nwell. \nTable-2 Performance of the global models for deriving CDOM (ag) and detritus (ad) absorption \ncoefficients at 443nm with their uncertainties \n \nModels \nDetritus (ad) at \n443nm(%) \nCDOM(ag) at \n443nm(%) \n(ad+ag) (%) \nLee-Morel-\nBricaud(LMB) \nN/A \nN/A \n33 \nGSM \nN/A \nN/A \n30 \nGupta model 2020 \nN/A \n36 \nN/A \nNew \n40 \n30 \n29 \n \nTable-3 Statistics of the performance of the global models for deriving CDOM (ag), detritus (ad) \nabsorption coefficients and their integrated response at 443nm \nModels \nR-Square \nRMSE \nSlope \nIntercept \nMean(ad, ag, \nad+ag) \nLMB[ad+ag] \n0.74 \n0.16 \n1.03 \n-0.007 \n0.21 \nGSM[ad+ag] \n0.84 \n0.14 \n1.22 \n-0.023 \n0.21 \nGupta model \n2020 [ag] \n0.82 \n0.1 \n1.09 \n-0.003 \n0.17 \nNew[ad, ag, \nad+ag] \n0.71,0.72,0.7 \n0.07,0.11,0.16 \n0.64,0.74,0.82 \n0.004,0.023,0.028 \n0.06,0.17,0.23 \n \n \n \nFig-6 A) GSM derived (ad+ag ) at 443 nm versus NOMAD (ad+ag ) at 443nm, B) Lee derived (ad+ag) at \n443 nm versus NOMAD (ad+ag ) at 443nm, C) Gupta et al, 2020 derived ag at 443 nm versus NOMAD ag \nat 443nm, D), E) and F) new parameterized based model derived ad, ag and (ad+ag ) at 443 nm versus \nNOMAD ad, ag and (ad+ag ) at 443nm respectively. \n \nConclusion \nIn this study, ABOM with suitable parameterization has been presented to derive chl-a in optically \ncomplex waters. In addition, an attempt was made to correct for the CDOM slope bias by introducing \nempirically derived expression in Fig. 3, using NOMAD data for global waters. This study concludes that \nABOM-derived chl-a (mg/m3) improves significantly with an uncertainty of 58% as compared to GSM \n(175%) and Lee–Bio (189%) algorithms. Further the study reveals the bio-optical models developed for \nglobal oceans needs to be regionally parameterized for optical components in complex waters bodies \nto accurately estimate the magnitudes of optical constituents.  \nSimilarly, in ABOM2, the study attempted to bring about improvement in the parameterization of Lee \ninversion model using the global NOMAD in-situ dataset. The parameterization to inversion model \nsuccessfully estimated detritus and CDOM absorption coefficients with uncertainty of 40% and 30%, \nrespectively. Also, the integrated response of CDOM and detritus after parameterization, had a lesser \nuncertainty of 29% as compared to GSM and Lee-Morel-Bricaud (LMB) model whose uncertainties \nwere 30% and 33%, respectively. Similar results can be obtained globally by introducing a new \nparameterization to inversion model for deriving detritus absorption. This might be quite significant in \nderiving the sub components of inherent optical properties (IOPs) within the acceptable uncertainty. \nAcknowledgment  \nWe acknowledge Director, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad for his continuous support \nfor pursuing this study.

Introduction \nSARAL/AltiKa is a follow-on mission to ENVISAT ESA’s mission and will have the same ground track. \nThe satellite name SARAL stands for SAtellite for ARgos and ALtiKa. This mission continues the \nseries of successful altimetric missions such as TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason missions. While they \nwere conducted under a cooperation between the French Space Agency, \"Centre National d'Etudes \nSpatiales\" (CNES), the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the \nEuropean Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), SARAL/AltiKa is a new collaboration \nbetween CNES and ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization). \n1.1. Overview of the SARAL/AltiKa product family \nThe purpose of this document is to assist users of the SARAL/AltiKa products (Operational \nGeophysical Data Record : OGDR, Interim Geophysical Data Record : IGDR, and Geophysical Data \nRecord : GDR) by providing a comprehensive description of product content and format. We will so \nrefer to (O)(I)GDR in this document when the information is relevant for all the products.  \n(O)(I)GDR products are identical except for the following differences regarding the auxiliary data \nused in the processing: \n \nAuxiliary Data \nImpacted Parameter \nOGDR \nIGDR \nGDR \nOrbit \nSatellite altitude, \nDoppler correction, … \nDORIS \nNavigator \nPreliminary \n(DORIS MOE) \nPrecise \n(DORIS+Laser \nPOE) \nPlatform \nMispointing angle \nNot available \nRestituted \n(MOE) \nRestituted \n(POE) \nMeteo Fields \nDry/wet tropospheric corrections, \nU/V wind vector, \nSurface pressure, \nInverted barometer correction, … \nPredicted \nRestituted \nPole Location \nPole tide height \nPredicted \nRestituted \nMog2D \nHF ocean dealiasing correction \nNot available \nPreliminary \nPrecise \nGIM \nIonosphere correction \nAvailable \nRadiometer antenna \ntemperatures coeff. \nWet tropospheric correction, \nSigma0 rain attenuation, … \nPreliminary \nPrecise \n(accounting for \nradiometer \ncalibration) \nTable 1 : Differences between Auxiliary Data for O/I/GDR Products \nGDR products, unlike OGDR and IGDR products, are fully validated products. \n1.1.1. Product contents \nThe Level-2 products from this mission comprise a family of nine different types of geophysical data \nrecords (GDRs). As illustrated in Table 1 below, there are three families of GDRs, distinguished by \nincreasing latency and accuracy, going from the Operational GDR (OGDR), to the Interim GDR \n(IGDR), to the final GDR. Within each of these three families there are up to three types of files in \nNetCDF format, with increasing size and complexity:  \n1. a reduced 1 Hz subset of the full dataset in NetCDF format (O/I/GDR-SSHA); \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n2 \n \n \n \n \n2. the native NetCDF formatted datasets (O/I/GDRs) which contain 1Hz records as well as 20 \nHz high-rate values; \n \n3. an expert sensor product containing the full radar-echo waveforms in NetCDF format (S-\nIGDR/S-GDR, not applicable to the OGDR).  \n \n \n \nTable 1.

Altimetric distances \nIn order to reduce confusion in discussing altimeter measurements and corrections, the following \nterms are used in this document as defined below:  \n· \nDistance and Length are general terms with no special meaning in this document \n· \nRange is the distance from the satellite to the surface of the Earth, as measured by the \naltimeter. Thus, the altimeter measurement is referred to as \"range\" or \"altimeter range,\" \nnot height \n· \nAltitude is the distance of the satellite or altimeter above a reference point. The reference \npoint used is the reference ellipsoid. This distance is computed from the satellite \nephemeris data \n· \nHeight is the distance of the sea surface above the reference ellipsoid. The sea surface \nheight is the difference of the altimeter range from the satellite altitude above the \nreference ellipsoid \n \nReference Ellipsoid\nOcean Bottom\nOcean Surface\nOrbit\nRange\nAltitude\nHeight\nReference Ellipsoid\nOcean Bottom\nOcean Surface\nOrbit\nRange\nAltitude\nHeight\n \nFigure 1 : Altimetric distances – Altitude, Range and Height \n1.4.1.2. Orbits, Revolutions, Passes, and Repeat Cycles \nAn Orbit is one circuit of the earth by the satellite as measured from one ascending node crossing \nto the next. An ascending node occurs when the sub satellite point crosses the earth's equator going \nfrom south to north. A Revolution (REV) is synonymous with orbit.  \nThe OGDR data is organized into files (“segments”) which corresponds to the amount of data \ndumped over an Earth terminal (typically 2 hour-data sets). \nThe (I)GDR data is organized into pass files in order to avoid having data boundaries in the middle \nof the oceans, as would happen if the data were organized by orbit. A Pass is half a revolution of \nthe earth by the satellite from extreme latitude to the opposite extreme latitude. \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n6 \n \n \n \nFor SARAL/AltiKa, an Ascending Pass begins at the latitude -81.49 deg and ends at +81.49 deg. A \nDescending Pass is the opposite (+81.49 deg to -81.49 deg). The passes are numbered from 1 to 501 \nrepresenting a full repeat cycle of the SARAL/AltiKa ground track. Ascending passes are odd \nnumbered and descending passes are even numbered.  \nAfter one repeat cycle of 501 passes, SARAL/AltiKa revisits the same ground-track within a margin \nof ±1 km. That means that every location along the SARAL/AltiKa ground-track is measured every \napproximately 35 days.  \n1.4.1.3. Reference Ellipsoid \nThe Reference Ellipsoid is the first-order definition of the non-spherical shape of the Earth as an \nellipsoid of revolution with equatorial radius of 6378.1363 kilometers and a flattening coefficient of \n1/298.257 (same reference ellipsoid as used by the Jason-1, SARAL/AltiKa and the T/P missions). \n1.4.2. Correction Conventions \nAll environmental and instrument corrections are computed so that they should be added to the \nquantity which they correct. That is, a correction is applied to a measured value by  \n \nCorrected Quantity = Measured Value + Correction \nThis means that a correction to the altimeter range for an effect that lengthens the apparent signal \npath (e.g., wet troposphere correction) is computed as a negative number. Adding this negative \nnumber to the uncorrected (measured) range reduces the range from its original value toward the \ncorrect value. Example: Corrected Range = Measured Range + Range Correction. \n1.4.3. Time Convention \nTimes are UTC and referenced to January 1, 2000 00:00:00.00.  \nA UTC leap second can occur on June 30 or December 31 of any year. The leap second is a sixty-first \nsecond introduced in the last minute of the day. Thus the UTC values (minutes:seconds) appear as: \n59:58 ; 59:59 ; 59:60 ; 00:00 ; 00:01.  \n1.4.4. Unit Convention \nAll distances and distance corrections are reported in tenths of millimeters (10-1 mm).  \n1.4.5. Flagging and Editing \nIn general, flagging consists of three parts: instrument flags (on/off), telemetry flags (preliminary \nflagging and editing) and data quality flags (geophysical processing flags).  \nInstrument flags provide information about the state of the various instruments on the satellite.  \nTelemetry flags are first based on instrument modes and checking of telemetry data quality. Only \nseverely corrupted data are not processed (i.e. data that cannot be correctly read on ground). Flag \nsetting is designed to get a maximum amount of data into the “Sensor Data Records” (part of the \nSGDR data sets). Science data are processed only when the altimeter is in tracking mode. \nQuality flags are determined from various statistical checks on the residuals after smoothing or \nfitting through the data themselves. These flags are set if gaps in the data are detected, or \nresiduals have exceeded predetermined thresholds, or if the gradients of the data exceed \npredetermined thresholds. \n \n \n \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n7 \n \n \n \n2. SARAL/AltiKa Mission Overview \n2.1. Altimetric background \nThree previous high-accuracy altimetric missions, TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P, launched in August 1992 \nand which last until October 2005), Jason-1 (launched in December 2001) and Jason-2 (launched in \nJune 2008) have been the key elements of a major turning point in physical oceanography, in terms \nof both scientific research and applications. Exceeding most initial specifications in terms of \naccuracy, T/P quickly became a unique tool to make significant progress in the understanding and \nmodeling of ocean circulation and consequently on its climatic impact. The success of the T/P \nmission was mainly due to an appropriate optimization of the system: instruments, satellite, and \norbit parameters were all specifically designed to fulfill the objectives of the mission. The T/P \nfollow-on mission, Jason-1, was engaged soon after with the aim to provide the same level of \nperformance, but with a significant decrease in weight and power needs, hence a much lower \nmission cost. In addition, near-real time applications were included in the main objectives of the \nmission. Jason-2 presents better tracking performance and continue the success story of altimetric \nmissions.  \nThese missions, individually as well as combined have made essential contributions in other \ndomains, like mean sea level surveys, tides, marine meteorology, geophysics and geodesy. Most \nnotably the tandem mission phase, where Jason-1 and T/P or Jason-1 and Jason-2 were flying on \nthe same orbit separated by only 70 s or 1 min, provided a unique opportunity for intercalibration \nof both systems, hence improving further the scientific data quality. High accuracy radar altimeter \nmissions are uniquely capable to globally and continuously observe the ocean and to better \nunderstand the short to long term changes of ocean circulation. They are now considered as \nessential components of global ocean observation systems. These systems integrate altimetric and \nother satellite and in-situ data into models and require the continuity and permanence of ocean \nmeasurements to produce time series over several decades.  \nThe near-real time and short term capability of Jason-1, Jason-2 as well as ENVISAT (from ESA, \nlaunched in March 2002) have fed several pilot experiments that demonstrated the growing \nimportance of operational ocean observation products and short-range ocean prediction for a \nvariety of applications (ship routing, environmental hazards, support to maritime industries).  \nAlso worth mentioning is the importance of wave and wind data provided by altimeter systems over \noceans. This information is routinely used in meteorological and research entities, either for \ncalibration of other data sets, assimilation in weather and wave models, or for statistical analysis. \n2.2. Introduction to SARAL/AltiKa mission \n2.2.1. Mission overview \nThe SARAL mission results from the common interest of both CNES and ISRO in studying ocean from \nspace using altimetry system and in promoting maximum use of the ARGOS Data Collecting System. \nIn the present document, we focus on the AltiKa part of the overall SARAL mission. \nRadar altimetry by satellite is a technique used in oceanography to measure, globally over the \noceans, the sea level needed to understand ocean circulation and its variability. The importance of \naltimetry data to better understand the ocean circulation and its impact on the climate of the \nEarth led to the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of satellites complemented by ERS1-2, GFO and \nENVISAT. With the launch of these missions began a data collection that must continue well into the \ncentury in order to monitor the inter-annual evolution and separate transient phenomena from \nsecular variations. \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n8 \n \n \n \nSARAL/AltiKa mission belongs to the global altimetry system and then participates to the precise \nand accurate observations of ocean circulation and sea surface elevation for its life time. \nThus it is the aim of AltiKa part of the SARAL mission to provide altimetric measurements designed \nto study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation with the same accuracy as the one provided by \nENVISAT mission and complementary to Jasons mission. \nThe AltiKa project developed by CNES is based on a large Ka-band altimeter (35.75 GHz, 500MHz), \n1st oceanographic altimeter using such a high frequency. The use of the Ka-band frequency will \nsupply more accurate measurements (improvement of the spatial and vertical resolution) enabling a \nbetter observation of ices, coastal areas, continental water bodies as well as the waves height. The \ndrawback of this Ka-band frequency is its sensitivity to rain that can lead to signal attenuation. \nThe SARAL/AltiKa mission is part of the operational satellite altimetry system, jointly with Jason-2, \nand enables to ensure the service continuity which is nowadays provided by ENVISAT altimeter \njointly with Jason-2 and Jason-1.  \nBy ensuring the observations continuity and widening the observation areas, CNES answers the wish \nof the oceanography community by bringing a description: \n• \nfor the meso-scale in open ocean, \n• \nin coastal areas, \n• \nfor the seasonal forecast, \n• \nfor the hydrology, \n• \nfor the climate studies. \nAltiKa data will thus contribute, along with data from others altimetry missions, to the \ndevelopment of operational oceanography, to our climate understanding and to the development of \nforecasting capabilities through data assimilation methods improvement in coupled ocean-\natmosphere coupling models, bio-chemistry models, etc. \n2.2.2. Mission objectives \nSARAL/AltiKa main scientific objective is to provide data products to oceanographic research user \ncommunity in studies leading to improve our knowledge of the ocean meso-scale variability, \nthanks to the improvement in spatial and vertical resolution brought by SARAL/AltiKa. \nOcean meso-scale variability is defined as a class of high-energy processes, with wave lengths \nwithin a 50km to 500km range, and with periods of a few days to one year. Kinetic energy of meso-\nscale variability is one order of magnitude more than mean circulation’s one. Description of meso-\nscale is thus essential for understanding ocean dynamics, including mean circulation and its climatic \neffects (through interactions of meso-scale turbulence with the mean flow). \nSARAL/AltiKa main scientific objective is divided in sub-themes including: \n• \nintrinsic scientific studies of ocean at meso-scale dynamics: observations, theoretical \nanalyses,  modelling, data assimilation, parameterization, ... \n• \nimprovement of our understanding of the oceanic component in the climate system: \ninvestigation of local processes at small or medium scale poorly known and understood \nat present, but which have an impact on the modelling of climate variability at large \nspatial and temporal scales. \n• \ncontribution to the study of coastal dynamic processes, especially small or medium \nscale phenomena, whose retrieval will enable to anticipate many downstream \napplications. \n• \ncontribution to operational oceanography which is seeking large amounts of in situ and \nspace observation data. \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n9 \n \n \n \nSARAL/AltiKa secondary objectives are notably the monitoring of the main continental waters level \n(lakes, rivers, closed seas), the monitoring of mean sea level variations, the observation of polar \noceans, the analysis and forecast of wave and wind fields, the study of continental ices (thanks to \nimproved performances of Ka-band) and sea ices, the access to low rains climatology (enabled in \ncounterpart to the sensitivity of Ka-band to clouds and low rains) and the marine biogeochemistry \n(notably through the role of the meso and sub-meso-scale physics). \nFurther details on science and applications of SARAL/AltiKa data products can be found in the ISRO-\nCNES SARAL/AltiKa Joint Science Plan document [AD2]. \n2.3. SARAL/AltiKa Mission \nThe SARAL/AltiKa mission is built on the heritage of T/P and Jason-1/2, with two driving ambitions: \n• \nEnsuring continuity of high quality measurements for ocean science  \n• \nProviding operational products for assimilation and forecasting applications \nThe SARAL mission has been set forth as a cooperation between CNES and ISRO. The sharing of \nresponsibilities between CNES and ISRO, as defined in the SARAL MoU, is as follow : \n→ CNES responsibilities : \n• \nProject Management: responsibility shared with ISRO \n• \nOverall SARAL system engineering \n• \nIntegrated Payload Module (PIM), including \no \nAltiKa mission payload \no \nARGOS-3 mission payload \n• \nSupport for SARAL Payload Module integration and test \n• \nGround System & Operations \no \nPolar X-band network stations \no \nCompatibility of L-band stations network required for the ARGOS-3/SARAL \nmission \no \nData communication network \no \nAltiKa Mission Centre \no \nNRT and OFL product processing software development, installation, training \nand support to operations (ISRO and EUMETSAT) \no \nNRT product processing, archiving, distribution to users outside India, with the \nsupport of EUMETSAT \no \nOFL product processing and distribution to users outside India \no \nDORIS product processing and distribution \no \nData providing to the ARGOS Global Processing Centers \no \nArchiving of all telemetry and products, and auxiliary data \n• \nUser services \n• \nAltiKa System Coordination with other altimetry missions in the frame of the SALP service ; \nexpertise and long term CALVAL \n→ ISRO responsibilities : \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n10 \n \n \n \n• \nProject Management : responsibility shared with CNES \n• \nSARAL satellite engineering \n• \nSSB Platform \n• \nPSLV Launch vehicle and services \n• \nSSB Platform \n• \nSARAL Satellite integration and test \n• \nGround System & Operations \no \nSatellite Control Centre \no \nS-band network stations \no \nX-band Hyderabad Shadnagar station (TBCnot necessarily on an operational \nbasis) \no \nData communication network \no \nNRT and OFL products processing and distribution to users within India \no \nArchiving of all telemetry and products, and auxiliary data \n• \nUser services \n \nThe SARAL satellite is planned to operate for a nominal period of five (5) years, with an objective \nat 7 years. However, the operations will be conducted throughout the whole SARAL satellite \nlifetime. \nSARAL/AltiKa was launched on X X 2012 at 0:00 GMT by a PSLV vehicle supplied by ISRO, from the \nmain ISRO launch base, the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, SHAR SRIHARIKOTA, 100 km North from \nChennai. It reached it’s nominal repetitive orbit on X X 2012. The start of cycle 1 occurred on X X \n2012 at 00:00:00 GMT.  \n2.4. SARAL/AltiKa Requirements \nThe major elements of the mission include: \n• \nAn Earth orbiting satellite carrying an altimetric system for measuring the height of the \nsatellite above the sea surface \n• \nA precision orbit determination system for referring the altimetric measurements to \ngeodetic coordinates \n• \nA data analysis and distribution system for processing the satellite data, verifying their \naccuracy, and making them available to the scientific community \n• \nA Principal Investigator program for feedback from operational applications and scientific \nstudies based on the satellite observations  \nThe sea-surface height measurement must be made with an accuracy of 3.4 cm or better (at 1 Hz) \nin order to meet the mission objectives. The SARAL/AltiKa satellite is specified and designed to \nfulfill the mission objectives (see AD 6) and to take over from the Jason-1/2 mission. As for Jason-\n1/2, distribution of altimetric products (non-validated) in near real time is planned. The interim \n(IGDR) and definitive (GDR) science products are delivered later (within 1.5 days for IGDR and \nwithin 40 days for GDR), following the model used for Jason-1 and Jason-2. \nTo ensure that science and mission goals are accomplished by the SARAL/AltiKa mission, the \nfollowing requirements were established.  \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n11 \n \n \n \n2.4.1. Accuracy of Sea-level Measurements \nGenerally speaking SARAL/AltiKa has been specified based on the Jason-2 state of the art, including \nimprovements in payload technology, data processing and algorithms or ancillary data (e.g: precise \norbit determination and meteorological model accuracy). The sea-surface height shall be provided \nwith a globally averaged RMS accuracy of 4.6 cm (1 sigma), or better, assuming 1 second averages.  \nThe instrumental and environmental corrections are provided with the appropriate accuracy to \nmeet this requirement. In addition to these requirements, a set of measurement-system goals was \nestablished based on the anticipated impact of off-line ground processing improvements. These \nimprovements are expected to enable reduction of sea-surface height errors to 2.8 cm RMS. \nKnowledge of the stability of the system is especially important to the goal of monitoring the \nchange in the global mean sea level, hence a specification on the system drift with a 1 mm/year \ngoal. \nThe following table provides a summary of specifications and error budget at the end of the \nverification phase. \n \n( for 1s average, 2m \nSWH, 1dB σ0) \nOGDR \n3 Hours \nIGDR \n1.5 days \nGDR \n40 days \nGOALS \nAltimeter noise \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n1 \nIonosphere \n0.6 \n0.3 \n0.3 \n0.3 \nSea state bias \n2 \n2 \n2 \n2 \nDry troposphere \n1.5 \n0.7 \n0.7 \n0.7 \nWet Troposphere \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1.2 \n1 \nAltimeter range \nafter corrections \n(RSS) \n4.5 \n3.5 \n3.5 \n2 \nOrbit (Radial \ncomponent) (RMS) \nReq : 30 \nGoal : 10 \nReq : 4 \nGoal : 2.5 \nReq : 3 \nGoal : 2 \n2 \nTotal RSS Sea \nSurface Height \nReq : 30.5 \nReq : 5.3 \nReq : 4.6 \n2.8 \nSignificant Wave \nHeight  (H1/3) \n10 % or 0.5m \n10% or 0.4 m \n10% or 0.4 m \n5% or 0.25m \nWind speed \n2 m/s \n1.7 m/s \n1.7 m/s \n1 m/s \nTable 2. Preliminary AltiKa Data Products error budget \n2.4.2. Sampling Strategy \nAs for Jason-1 and Jason-2, sea level shall be measured along a fixed grid of subsatellite tracks such \nthat it is possible to investigate and minimize the spatial and temporal aliases of surface \ngeostrophic currents and to minimize the influence of the geoid on measurements of the time-\nvarying topography.  \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n12 \n \n \n \n2.4.3. Tidal Aliases \nAs for Jason-1 and Jason-2, sea level shall be measured such that tidal signals are not aliased into \nsemiannual, annual, or zero frequencies (which influences the calculation of the permanent \ncirculation) or frequencies close to these.  \n2.4.4. Duration and coverage \nSea level shall be measured for a minimum of five years, with the potential to extend this period \nfor an additional two years.  \nThe SARAL/AltiKa satellite shall overfly the reference ENVISAT ground tracks.  \n2.5. Mission Description \nSARAL/AltiKa will use an Earth orbiting satellite equipped with a radar altimeter and other \ninstruments to directly measure sea-surface elevation along the fixed grid of sub-satellite ground \ntracks traced out by the ERS1/2 and ENVISAT satellites. In so doing, SARAL/AltiKa will continue the \ndata collection started with ERS1/2 and followed by ENVISAT. The sea-surface height measurement \nmust be made with an accuracy of 4.6 cm or better (at 1 Hz) in order to meet the mission \nobjectives. The SARAL/AltiKa satellite is specified and designed to fulfill the mission objectives and \nwill be launched in 2012 to take over for ENVISAT mission.  \nThe ocean topography is obtained through three basic measurements:  \n1) the satellite range above the sea surface derived from the altimeter,  \n2) the tropospheric range delay measured by the radiometer to correct the altimeter range,  \n3) the altitude of the satellite above the reference ellipsoid derived from precise orbit \ndetermination.  \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n13 \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2. Geometry of the sea surface height measurement by altimetry \nThe altimeter uses radar pulses to determine precisely the distance between the satellite and the \nocean surface by measuring the time taken by the emitted pulse to return. The shape and the \namplitude of the echo enable the estimation of wave height and wind speed respectively. \nGeophysical corrections are then applied to compensate for the measurement errors introduced by \npropagation through the troposphere and ionosphere and errors induced by sea state. \nFurther information and details about radar altimetry principles and processing can be found on the \nfollowing link : http://www.altimetry.info/html/alti/welcome_en.html  \n \n2.6. Satellite Description \nThe 450 kg satellite consists of a SSB/ IMS-2 platform and a SARAL/AltiKa specific payload module. \nThe platform provides all housekeeping functions including propulsion, electrical power, command \nand data handling, telecommunications, and attitude control. The payload module provides \nmechanical, electrical, thermal, and dynamical support to the SARAL/AltiKa instruments.  \nThe SARAL satellite is mainly composed of: \n• \na spacecraft bus IMS-2 (Small Satellite Bus).

Sensors \n2.6.2.1. AltiKa Altimeter \nThe mono-frequency Ka-band (35.75 GHz) radar altimeter is the main part of AltiKa instrument. Its \nfunctions are based on proven concepts and already developed sub-systems, as it inherits from Siral \n(CRYOSAT mission) and Poseidon3 (Jason-2 mission). \nThe use of a single frequency is possible because ionosphere effects are negligible at such high \nfrequencies (proportionality to the inverse of the squared frequency).  \nThe main advantage of this higher frequency (Ka versus classical Ku/C altimeters) is the reduced \naltimeter footprint that leads to a better spatial resolution. The added advantage of AltiKa is due \nto its enhanced bandwidth (500 MHz), which leads to higher vertical resolution. Thus, globally, an \nerror budget improvement is expected. \nHowever, Ka-band has also drawbacks, mainly linked to its higher sensitivity to rainy and cloudy \nconditions. \nThe altimeter antenna is a fixed offset paraboloid (1 meter diameter) and directed toward nadir of \nthe satellite. It will be located on the top of the satellite. \n \n \nFigure 4 : SARAL/AltiKa Instrument \n2.6.2.2.  Dual frequency microwave radiometer \nThe bi-frequency (23.8 GHz / 37 GHz) radiometer is used to correct altimetry measurements from \nwet troposphere crossing effects. The 23.8 GHz channel is the primary water vapor sensing channel, \nmeaning higher water vapor concentrations will lead to larger 23.8 GHz brightness temperature \nvalues. The addition of the 37 GHz channel, which has less sensitivity to water vapor, facilitate the \nremoval of the contributions from cloud liquid water, which also act to increase the 23.8 GHz \nbrightness temperature. \nThe antenna, shared with the altimeter, is fed by a two frequency coaxial corrugated horn feed. \nA corrugated cold sky horn is used for the gain calibration of the 2 radiometer channels. \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n16 \n \n \n \n     \n \nFigure 5 : SARAL/AltiKa radiometer Instrument and antenna (shared with altimeter) \n2.6.2.3. DORIS System \nThe complete DORIS system includes the DORIS on board package, a network of approximately 60 \nbeacons located around the world and a ground system. \nThe on board package includes the electronic box hosting the receiver itself and the ultra stable \noscillator and an omnidirectional antenna. \nThe DORIS on board package is of the same version than the one embarked on SARAL/ALTIKA. It \nincludes a 7-beacon receiving capability and an on-board real time function (DIODE for « \nDétermination Immédiate d’Orbite par DORIS Embarqué ») to compute the orbit ephemeris in real \ntime. \nThe DORIS on board package is dual string (in cold redundancy), each DORIS chain is automatically \nconnected to the single antenna through a switching box inside the DORIS unit . Each receiver is \nconnected to its own ultra-stable oscillator. \nThe DORIS antenna is located on the Earth panel of the satellite. \n    \n \nFigure 6 : SARAL/AltiKa DORIS Receiver Antenna and Instrument \n2.6.2.4. Laser Reflector Array (LRA) \nIt is used for precise calibration of other POD instruments, through analysis of laser shots from the \nground then reflected by the LRA mirrors. \nThe laser reflector array is placed on the nadir face of the satellite. It consists of several quartz \ncorner cubes arrayed as a truncated cone with one in the center and the others distributed \nazimuthally around the cone. \nThe LRA is provided by CNES.  \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n17 \n \n \n \n    \nFigure 7 : SARAL/AltiKa Laser Reflector Array \n2.6.2.5. ARGOS-3 Instrument \nARGOS is a Data Collection and Localization System dedicated to environmental applications \n(more than 18000 active platforms). This is a CNES / EUMETSAT / NOAA cooperation and ISRO will \njoin the ARGOS Program with SARAL. Now in its 3rd generation of instruments embarked on \nEUMETSAT/Metop and NOAA/POES (NOAA-N’), ARGOS-3 on SARAL will fill the 3rd orbit (@ 18h00) of \nARGOS-3 system.  \n \nFigure 8 : Applications of the ARGOS system \nARGOS-3 UHF and L band antennas are located on the Earth face of the satellite. \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n18 \n \n \n \n \nFigure 9 : SARAL/AltiKa UHF antenna \n \n \nFigure 10 : SARAL/AltiKa ARGOS-3 reception instrument \n \n2.6.3.

The frequency of maneuvers depends \nprimarily on the solar flux as it affects the Earth's atmosphere, and there are expected to be one \nmaneuver (or series of maneuvers) every 15 to 30 days.  \nEach orbit maintenance maneuver is performed using only one thrust to minimize impacts on the \nground orbit solution. Orbit computation is optimized to minimize the orbit error during such \nperiods.

The SARAL/AltiKa Project Phases \nThe satellite mission has two main phases (verification and operational).   \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n31 \n \n \n \n \nFigure 12 : SARAL Mission Phases and associated responsibilities \n2.6.4.1. The verification phase \nThe verification phase (9 -10 months since beginning of cycle 1) began shortly after launch, when \nthe satellite reached the operational (nominal repetitive) orbit and the satellite and sensor systems \nwere functioning normally. This phase continued until the data received from the sensors were \nsatisfactorily calibrated and verified.  \nDuring this calibration/validation phase, the quality control will be achieved through many steps as \na series of quality controls designed to ensure a continuous supply of data : regular cyclic data \nproduct analysis (complete parameter analysis and diagnostics, missions/edited measurements, \ncrossovers and along-track analysis, orbit analysis, …), cross-calibration with other altimeters \n(SARAL/AltiKa,…), instrumental expertise for altimeter and radiometer monitoring, and by \nperforming absolute calibration at dedicated in situ calibration sites. \nThis verification phase is divided in 2 phases which overlap:  \n1. One dedicated to the validation of the near real time products (OGDRs).  \n2. The second phase dedicated to the validation of the off-line products (IGDR and GDR).  \n2.6.4.2. The operational (routine and long-term CALVAL activities) \nThe operational phase begins after the successful validation of each product type, and when all \nnecessary algorithm and processing changes are implemented to have SARAL/AltiKa performances \nat the same level as other altimetric satellites. Beyond the CALVAL phase, it is necessary to \nperform regular long-term CALVAL in order to monitor biases and drifts of AltiKa overall system: in \naddition to previously mentioned analysis, comparison of SARAL/AltiKa data with global and \nregional networks of in situ data (tide gauges, T/S profiles, …) will be performed as soon as enough \nin situ data are available (~1 year after launch). These different analysis will also be implemented  \nin order to calibrate and validate new ground processing algorithms that could be proposed and \nimplemented during the CALVAL phase.  \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n32 \n \n \n \nConsidering the specificities of SARAL/AltiKa mission, particular attention will be given to evaluate \nand monitor the mission performances over coastal and inland water areas, over polar oceans and \nice surfaces, as well as under rainy/cloudy conditions, with respect to previous and other in-flight \naltimetry missions. \n2.7. Data Processing and Distribution \nProcessing centers perform functions such as science data processing, data verification and orbit \ndetermination. \nThere are three levels of processed data: \n• \nTelemetry data (raw data or level0) \n• \nSensor Data Records (engineering units or level1) \n• \nGeophysical Data Records (geophysical units or level2) \nThere are two kinds of data processing and distribution: \n• \nReal-time processing and distribution (EUMETSAT and ISRO/NRSC) \nThe operational geophysical data record (OGDR) is available with a latency of 3-5 hours. Note \nthat this is a non-validated product that uses orbits computed by the on-board DORIS Navigator \n(DIODE) and that does not contain all the environmental/geophysical corrections.  \n• \nDelayed-mode processing and distribution (CNES and ISRO/SAC) \nThe interim geophysical data record (IGDR) is available per pass with a latency of less than 1.5 \ndays. Note that this is not a fully validated product, although it uses a preliminary orbit and \nincludes all the environmental/geophysical corrections (preliminary for some of them). This \nproduct is generated by CNES only. \nThe geophysical data record (GDR) is a fully validated product that uses a precise orbit and the \nbest environmental/geophysical corrections. This product is available per repeat cycle with a \nlatency of 40 days. Validation is performed by CNES teams to ensure in depth validation. GDR \nproducts are generated both by CNES and ISRO/SAC. \nGeophysical data records are disseminated to users as they become available, as well as ingested in \ntwo main archives (at CNES and ISRO), where they are made available to the scientific community, \nISRO being in charge of data dissemination to Indian community and CNES to the rest of the \nscientific community. \nThe NRT and offline data are provided through different sources and means as discussed below. \nNote that the telemetry acquisition strategy, designed to minimize the risk of science data loss, \nsometimes results in files containing data which overlaps in time. The NRT ground processing does \nnot remove these overlaps, so it is possible to encounter two or more OGDR products which have \noverlapping start and stop sensing times. CNES-EUMETSAT-ISRO centers are disseminating \nSARAL/AltiKa products according to the interagency agreement.  \n• \nCNES via AVISO data service: http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com \n“Archiving, Validation and Interpretation of Satellite Oceanographic data” is the French multi-\nsatellite data distribution center dedicated to space oceanography, developed by CNES. \n \nAVISO distributes and archives SARAL/AltiKa delayed-time data (IGDR, GDR). \n• \nEUMETSAT: http://www.eumetsat.int \nEUMETSAT is the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites.

NRT data access  \nOperational users requiring near real-time access (within a few hours of acquisition) can receive \ndata via EUMETCast, which is the prime dissemination mechanism for EUMETSAT satellite data and \nmeteorological products. EUMETCast is also used to deliver data supplied by several external data \nproviders. \nEUMETCast is an environmental data and product dissemination system based on standard Digital \nVideo Broadcast (DVB) technology. It uses commercial telecommunication geostationary satellites \nto broadcast data and products to a wide user community. EUMETSAT operates three EUMETCast \nbroadcasts: EUMETCast Europe in Ku-band via Hotbird-6 EUMETCast Africa in C-band via \nAtlanticBird-3 and EUMETCast South America in C-band via NewSkies-806. The coverage zones of \nthese broadcasts are shown in Figure below. The SARAL/AltiKa products are currently disseminated \nover all beams. \n \n \n \nFigure 11 : GEONETCast Coverage Zones \n \nEUMETCast is part of a wider data dissemination cooperation network known as GEONETCast, \ndefined as a global network of satellite based data dissemination systems providing environmental \ndata to a world-wide user community. The current partners within the GEONETCast initiative \ninclude the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the World Meteorological \nOrganization (WMO) and EUMETSAT, as well as many prospective data provider partners.  \nEUMETCast is a multi-service dissemination mechanism and other environmental data streams and \nproducts are also delivered via EUMETCast : \n• \nSpace-based observations from the Meteosat, Metop, GOES, MT-SAT and FY2 satellites – at \ntheir most frequent, these data are delivered to Users within 5-minutes of processing \n• \nMODIS level 1and 2 products covering selective geographical regions \n• \nNumerical Weather Forecasts \n• \nIn-situ observational data \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n35 \n \n \n \n• \nLand application products covering Europe, Africa and South America \n• \nMarine meteorological and ocean surface products covering the Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea \nand Yellow Sea \n• \nAtmospheric chemistry products \nEUMETCast has an installed user base of over 2500 stations worldwide. \nA typical EUMETCast reception station comprises a standard PC with DVB card inserted and a \nsatellite off-set antenna fitted with a digital universal V/H LNB. All components of the reception \nstation are commercially available. The hardware costs for a single PC station for EUMETCast \nEurope (Ku-band) reception start at around €1,500. In addition, EUMETCast Client Software package \nis required for handling the incoming DVB and storing it as data files. This package is available \ndirectly from EUMETSAT at a one of fee of €100and forms part of any registration process. \nFurther information on EUMETCast can be found on the EUMETSAT Web site at: \nhttp://www.eumetsat.int/Home/Main/What_We_Do/EUMETCast/index.htm?l=en  or alternatively \nfollow the links to ‘What We Do’-‘EUMETCast’. Note that the coverage of EUMETCast is achieved \nthrough different beams, and the user location will determine the technical requirements of the \nEUMETCast reception station equipment. \nThe SARAL/AltiKa products available via EUMETCast are the EUMETSAT and ISRO injected OGDR and \nOGDR-SSHA. To access these on EUMETCast, users are requested to register online via the \nEUMETSAT Web site, or to contact the EUMETSAT User Service Helpdesk. As for Jason-2 near real-\ntime products, already disseminated by EUMETSAT via EUMETCast, the SARAL/AltiKa products will \nbe disseminated on all EUMETCast channels (Europe, Americas and Africa). \nAll enquiries related to EUMETCast can be addressed to the EUMETSAT User Helpdesk, email \nops@eumetsat.int, who will be happy to assist with information on reception station manufacturers, \nreception station setup and data access registration to the SARAL/AltiKa service, or indeed to other \nnear real-time EUMETSAT data services. \n2.9.2. Access to archived data  \nThe SARAL/AltiKa products generated and distributed by EUMETSAT in near real-time (i.e., OGDR \nand OGDR-SSHA) are also archived in the multi-mission EUMETSAT Archive. Any user can access \nSARAL/AltiKa data from the EUMETSAT archive upon registration. Information on registration, the \narchive itself and how to use it can be found at http://archive.eumetsat.org/umarf  or follow the \nlinks to ‘Access to Data’ and then ‘Archive Service’. Data delivery media include, among others, \ndirect ftp push to a provided IP address, including the possibility of establishing standing orders, or \ndownload by the user from an html page. Note however that this is not a near real-time data \naccess, but that it can take up to several hours and occasionally even days to get the data. \n2.10. CNES data distribution \n2.10.1. Details of off line data access via CNES \nUsers have access to SARAL/AltiKa public data through a dedicated AVISO ftp server with an \nanonymous account (nevertheless, please note that users shall be registered before downloading \nproducts in order to be identified by AVISO helpdesk and to receive altimetric news.

Geoid \nSARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDRs use the EGM96 geopotential to compute the geoid [Lemoine et al., 1998]. \nThe EGM96 geopotential model has been used to calculate point values of geoid undulation on a \n0.25 x 0.25 degree grid that spans the latitude range +85.0 deg. to -85.0 deg. The EGM96 model is \ncomplete to spherical harmonic degree and order 360, and has been corrected appropriately so as \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n43 \n \n \n \nto refer to the mean tide system as far as the permanent tide is concerned [Rapp et al., 1991]. The \nk2 Love number used in this conversion was 0.3. The geoid undulations are given with respect to an \nideal geocentric mean Earth ellipsoid, whose semi-major axis remains undefined (i.e., there is no \nzero-degree term in the spherical harmonic series of these geoid undulations). The flattening of this \nreference ellipsoid is f=1/298.257 so that values are consistent with constants adopted for T/P. \nSince the geoid undulations have been computed from an expansion to degree 360, the resolution of \nthe undulations will be on the order of 50km. Data used to derived the EGM96 model include \nsurface gravity data from different regions of the globe, altimeter derived gravity anomalies from \nthe GEOSAT Geodetic Mission, altimeter derived anomalies from ERS-1, direct satellite altimetry \nfrom T/P, ERS-1 and GEOSAT, and satellite tracking to over 20 satellites using satellite laser \nranging, GPS, DORIS, the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS), and TRANET. \n \nFigure 15 : EGM96 geoid \nMore information on EGM96 can be found at http://cddisa.gsfc.nasa.gov/926/egm96/egm96.html \n3.2.5. Bathymetry \nThe value of this parameter is determined from the DTM2000.1 model from N. Pavlis and J. Saleh \n[personal communication, 2000] of the Raytheon ITSS/Goddard Space Flight Center. The model is \nprovided globally with a 2' resolution. The heritage of DTM2000.1 goes back to the OSUJAN98 \ndatabase [Pavlis and Rapp, 1990] and the JGP95E database [Chapter 2 of Lemoine et al., 1998]. The \nbathymetric information in DTM2000.1 (originating from Smith and Sandwell's [1994] global sea \nfloor topography) has significant differences with the ETOPO5 bathymetric model. The mean and \nstandard deviation of these differences is 10 m and 270 m, respectively. \n \n3.2.6. Ocean Tides \nThe two geocentric tide values provided on the SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR, ocean_tide_sol1 and \nocean_tide_sol2, are computed with diurnal and semidiurnal ocean and load tide values predicted \nby the GOT4.8 and FES2004 models, respectively.  \nBoth geocentric ocean tide fields (ocean_tide_sol1 and ocean_tide_sol2) also include the load tides \nfrom the respective models (load_tide_sol1 and load_tide_sol2), and the equilibrium long-period \nocean tide (ocean_tide_equil). These two fields (ocean_tide_sol1 and ocean_tide_sol2) also include \nthe S1 oceanic response to atmospheric pressure based on the model from Ray and Egbert (2004). \nThe FES2004 model also includes the M4 ocean tide. Note that the load tide fields (load_tide_sol1 \nand load_tide_sol2) only include the load tides from the GOT4.8 and FES2004 models, and do not \ncontain the load tides from the S1, M4, or equilibrium long-period ocean tides. \nBoth models are interpolated to provide the geocentric ocean and load tides at the location of the \naltimeter measurement, and an interpolation quality flag is provided on the (O)(I)GDRs to indicate \nthe quality of this interpolation (see interp_flag_ocean_tide_sol1 and interp_flag_ocean_tide_sol2).  \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n44 \n \n \n \n3.2.6.1.

An a priori model was used that consisted of the hydrodynamic model FES 2004 \n[Lyard et al. 2006], and several other local hydrodynamic models, GOT4.8 implement the fixed-up \ndry troposphere correction for TP where the air tide wasn't being handled correctly (whereas it is in \nJason GDRs), and this affects S2 mostly.  \nAnother difference between GOT4.7 and GOT4.8 is that 4.7 had not applied the TP Cg correction, \nwhile 4.8 did use the Cg. \n  \n \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n45 \n \n \n \n3.2.6.2. FES2004 Ocean Tide Model  \nThe FES2004 model is a finite-element hydrodynamic model, constrained with tide gage and past \naltimeter data [Le Provost, 2001] (see ocean_tide_sol2). \nIt is based on the resolution of the tidal barotropic equations on a global finite element grid \nwithout any open boundary condition, which leads to solutions independent of in situ data (no open \nboundary conditions and no data assimilation). FES2004 is the last update of the FES solution. Tide \ngages and reprocessed TP and ERS crossover data are assimilated in the FES2002 hydrodynamical \nsolution. The altimeter data reprocessing consists in a new atmospherical forcing response \ncorrection (Mog2D-G) applied to the data before the harmonic analysis. FES2004 includes the M2, \nS2, N2, K2, 2N2, K1, O1, P1, Q1 tides. Four hydrodynamical long period tides and the non-linear M4 \ntide are also included in the distribution package. A new prediction algorithm is associated with \nFES2004. This algorithm use an admittance method to extends the prediction spectrum up to 36 \ntidal constituents. The FES2004 model also provides non-equilibrium models for the Mm, Mf, Mtm, \nand Msqm tidal components, which are provided by parameter ocean_tide_non_equil. \nSee http://www.legos.obs-mip.fr/en/soa/cgi/getarc/v0.0/index.pl.cgi?donnees=maregraphie&produit=modele_fes \n3.2.7. Sea Surface Height Bias Recommendation  \nThe estimate of the absolute bias in the SARAL/AltiKa sea-surface height measurements (SSH) is one \nof the goals of the Cal/Val phase and is therefore not fully consolidated at this time.  \nThe Sea State Bias (SSB) can be defined as the difference between the apparent sea level as “seen” \nby the altimeter and the actual mean sea level. It is composed of : the Electromagnetic bias (EMB), \nand skewness and tracker biases that affect the accuracy of altimeter measurements and are all \ndependent on SWH. The EMB (main contributor) results from the fact that the radar senses an \naverage sea surface lower than the true average sea surface, due to amplification from wave \ntroughs. This bias can be expressed as a percentage of SWH, with the percentage being a complex \nfunction of the sea-surface slope and elevation statistical distribution.  \nAs a first guess, we assume that the SSB value is 3.5% of SWH. A consolidated SSB solution will be \ncomputed about one year after launch, to interpolate the SSB value bilinearly from a table \n(empirical model derived from analyses of the altimeter data) as a function of SWH and wind speed.  \nIt should be noted that the bias reflects the combination of the mean errors from all of the \ncorrections that are used to compute sea surface height. \nWe expect very good SARAL/AltiKa data quality. However, some particular contributors have \nunknown or hard to estimate error contributions, simply because SARAL/AltiKa mission is so \ninnovative (Ka-band altimeter) that a lack of information and experience prevents us to get a \nprecise pre-launch error estimation: this is the case for “sea state bias correction”, “ionosphere \ncorrection for OGDR”, and “wind speed” error estimations. \n \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n46 \n \n \n \n3.2.8. Data Editing Criteria \nThe following editing criteria are a recommended guideline for finding good records from the \n(O)(I)GDR version “d” to calculate the sea level anomaly from the Ku band range.

Recommendations for the use of SARAL/AltiKa data in coastal and \nhydrological areas may be provided to users later. \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n47 \n \n \n \n4. Using the (O)(I)GDR data \n4.1. Overview \nThis section gives the reader a guide to the use of the SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR data. While this \nhandbook tries to be correct and complete, note that nothing can replace the information to be \ngained at conferences and other meetings from those using these data. The reader must proceed \nwith caution and at his or her own risk. Further information is also available on the web servers \nprovided in Annex C, please direct questions and comments to the contacts given there.  \nThe instruments on SARAL/AltiKa make direct observations of the following quantities: altimeter \nrange, ocean significant wave height, ocean radar backscatter cross-section (a measure of wind \nspeed) and tropospheric water content. Ground based laser station and DORIS station \nmeasurements of the satellite location and speeds are used in precision orbit determination (POD). \nThe DORIS stations also measure the ionospheric electron content along the line of sight to the \nsatellite. All of these measurements are useful in themselves, but they are made primarily to derive \nthe sea surface height with the highest possible accuracy. Such a computation also needs external \ndata (not collected aboard SARAL/AltiKa), e.g., atmospheric pressure, etc. In addition, instrument \nhealth and calibration data are collected onboard and used to make corrections to the main \nmeasurements and to monitor the instrument stability in the long term.  \nThis (O)(I)GDR contains all relevant corrections needed to calculate the sea surface height. For the \nother \"geophysical variables\" in the (O)(I)GDR: ocean significant wave height, tropospheric water \ncontent and wind speed, the needed instrument and atmospheric corrections have already been \napplied.  \nThe following sections explain the rationale for how the corrections should be applied.  \n4.2. Typical computation from altimetry data \nIn this section references are made to specific (O)(I)GDR parameters by name using the name of the \nvariable as described in the NetCDF data sets.  \nWARNING \nDefault values are given to data when computed values are not available (See section 6.1.2.4) \nso you must screen parameters to avoid using those with default values. Also you must check \nflag values. The related flags are given in the description of each variable (See section 6.1.2.4) \nalthough some discussion of flags appears in this section.  \n4.2.1. Corrected Altimeter Range \nThe main data of the (O)(I)GDR are the altimeter ranges. The (O)(I)GDR provides ranges measured \nat Ka band. The given range is corrected for instrumental effects (net_instr_corr_range_ka). The \ngiven range must be corrected for path delay in the atmosphere through which the radar pulse \npasses and the nature of the reflecting sea surface. All range corrections are defined and they \nshould be ADDED to the range. The corrected (Ka band) range is given by : \nCorrected Range = Range  + Wet Troposphere Correction  \n \n+ Dry Troposphere Correction  \n \n+ Ionosphere Correction  \n \n+ Sea State Bias Correction \nWet Troposphere Correction :  \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n48 \n \n \n \nUse radiometer correction (rad_wet_tropo_corr). \nDry Troposphere Correction :  \nUse model correction (model_dry_tropo_corr).  \nIonosphere Correction :  \nUse model ionosphere correction (iono_corr_gim). \nSea State Bias Correction : \nUse sea state bias correction (sea_state_bias). \n4.2.2. Sea Surface Height and Sea Level Anomaly \nSea surface height (SSH) is the height of the sea surface above the reference ellipsoid. It is \ncalculated by subtracting the corrected range from the Altitude:  \nSea Surface Height = Altitude - Corrected Range \n \nThe sea level anomaly (SLA), also referred to as Residual Sea Surface, is defined here as the sea \nsurface height minus the mean sea surface and minus known geophysical effects, namely tidal and \ninverse barometer. It is given by:  \nSea Level Anomaly = Sea Surface Height  \n \n- Mean Sea Surface \n \n- Solid Earth Tide Height  \n \n- Geocentric Ocean Tide Height  \n \n- Pole Tide Height  \n \n- Inverted Barometer Height Correction  \n \n- HF Fluctuations of the Sea Surface Topography \n \nThe SLA contains information about: \n· \nReal changes in ocean topography related to ocean currents  \n· \nDynamic response to atmospheric pressure \n· \nDifferences between tides and the tide models  \n· \nDifferences between the mean sea surface model and the true mean sea surface at the \nSARAL/AltiKa location  \n· \nUnmodeled or mismodeled measurement effects (skewness, sea state bias, altimeter errors, \ntropospheric corrections, ionospheric correction, etc.)  \n· \nOrbit errors  \nThere is naturally also random measurement noise. Understanding the first four items as a function \nof space and time is the purpose of SARAL/AltiKa.  \nAltitude : \nOrbit altitude (see parameter altitude)  \nCorrected Range : \nSee section 4.2.1.  \nTide effects (solid earth tide height, geocentric ocean tide height, pole tide height) : \nSee sections 4.2.2.1 and 5.9. \nInverted Barometer Height Correction : \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n49 \n \n \n \nUse inv_bar_corr (see also section 5.10). \nHF Fluctuations of the Sea Surface Topography : \nUse hf_fluctuations_corr (see also section 5.10). \nMean Sea Surface : \nSee sections 4.2.2.2 and 5.4.  \n4.2.2.1. Tide Effects \nThe total tide effect on the sea surface height is the sum of three values from the (O)(I)GDR:  \nTide Effect = Geocentric Ocean Tide + Solid Earth Tide + Pole Tide  \n(See also section 5.9 and subsections)  \nGeocentric Ocean Tide : \nThe geocentric ocean tide provided on the (O)(I)GDR is actually the sum total of the ocean tide \nwith respect to the ocean bottom, and the loading tide height of the ocean bottom.  \nGeocentric Ocean Tide = Ocean Tide + Load Tide \nThe (O)(I)GDR provides a choice of two geocentric ocean tide values, ocean_tide_sol1 and \nocean_tide_sol2. Each uses a different model for the sum total of the ocean tide and loading tide \nheights from the diurnal and semidiurnal tides, but both include an equilibrium representation of \nthe long-period ocean tides at all periods except for the zero frequency (permanent tide) term. \nNote that the (O)(I)GDR also explicitly provides the loading tide height from each of the two models \nthat are used to determine the two geocentric ocean tide values, load_tide_sol1, load_tide_sol2. \nObviously, the geocentric ocean tide values and loading tide values should not be used \nsimultaneously, since the loading tide height would be modeled twice. \nSolid Earth Tide : \nUse solid_earth_tide \nNOTE: Zero frequency (permanent tide) term also not included in this parameter. \nPole Tide : \nUse pole_tide  \nThe tide values all have the same sign/sense in that positive numbers indicate that the surface is \nfarther from the center of the Earth.  \n4.2.2.2. Geophysical Surface - Mean Sea Surface or Geoid \nThe geophysical fields Geoid (geoid) - actually geoid undulation, but called simply geoid - and Mean \nSea Surface (mean_sea_surface) are distances above the reference ellipsoid, as is the Sea Surface \nHeight. These values are for the location indicated by latitude and longitude. If the values of these \nfields are needed at a different location within the current frame, along-track interpolation may be \ndone using the high rate (40/second) range and altitude values.  \nAs the geoid is derived from the mean sea surface, the latter is the better-known quantity. The \nresidual surface with respect to the geoid is sometimes called the \"dynamic topography\" of the \nocean surface.  \nSee also discussions of mean sea surface and geoid in sections 5.3 and 5.4.  \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n50 \n \n \n \n4.2.3. Mean Sea Surface and Adjustment of the Cross Track Gradient \nIn order to study sea level changes between two dates, it is necessary to difference sea surface \nheights from different cycles at the exact same latitude-longitude, so that the not well-known \ntime-invariant geoid cancels out. However, the (O)(I)GDR samples are not given at the same \nlatitude-longitude on different cycles. They are given approximately every 1 sec along the pass \n(about 6 km, the time difference and distance vary slightly with satellite height above the surface), \nand the satellite ground track is allowed to drift by +1 km. This introduces a problem: on different \ncycles the satellite will sample a different geoid profile. This effect is the so-called cross-track \ngeoid gradient, and Brenner and Koblinsky [1990] estimated it at about 2 cm/km over most of the \nocean, larger over continental slopes, reaching 20 cm/km at trenches. Even if the passes repeated \nexactly, one would have to interpolate along the pass (say, to a fixed set of latitudes) because a 3 \nkm mismatch in along pass position would cause approximately a 6 cm difference in the geoid, \nwhich would mistakenly be interpreted as a change in oceanographic conditions.  \nBoth problems are simultaneously solved if the quantity one interpolates along a given pass is the \ndifference : \nResidual Height – Mean Sea Surface  \nThen the real geoid changes across the track are automatically accounted for (to the extent the \nMSS model is close to the true geoid) because the MSS is spatially interpolated to the actual \nsatellite latitude-longitude in the (O)(I)GDR. The residual height term above is the residual sea \nsurface height after applying all the tidal, atmospheric and ionospheric corrections, etc. Otherwise, \nthose need to be interpolated separately.  \nOne possible approach is to interpolate along track to a set of common points, a \"reference\" track. \nThe reference could be: \n· \nAn actual pass with maximum data and/or minimum gaps, or  \n· \nA specially constructed fixed track (see below).  \nThe procedure is the following: \n· \nFor each common point, find neighboring points in the pass of interest (POI).  \n· \nIn the POI, interpolate along track to the common point, using longitude as the independent \nvariable, for each quantity of interest - sea surface height (see above), mean sea surface, \ngeoid, tides, etc.  \n· \nAs stated above, the quantity to compare at each common point is :  \nΔSSH = Interpolated POI SSH - Interpolated POI MSS  \n· \nOther geophysical corrections must be applied to ΔSSH, depending on the type of \ninvestigation  \nThe geoid model in the (O)(I)GDR could substitute the MSS model, but its use will result in reduced \naccuracy in the interpolation because the resolution of the geoid undulation is lower than that of \nthe MSS.  \nDesirable features of a fixed reference track include:  \n· \nEqual spacing of points (good for FFT)  \n· \nIndependent variable = (point longitude - pass equator crossing longitude)  \n· \nEquator is a point (simplifies calculation)  \n· \nPoint density similar to original data density \nWith these specifications, it is possible to make only two fixed tracks, one ascending and one \ndescending, which will serve for all passes. The template pass is then shifted by the equator \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n51 \n \n \n \ncrossing longitude (global attribute of the product, see 6.2) of each pass. Recall that the equator \nlongitude is from a predicted orbit (not updated during GDR processing). Improved accuracy can be \nobtained by interpolating in the latitude, longitude values. When one interpolates to the reference \ntrack, it is good practice to check that the interpolated latitude from the data records used is close \nto the latitude on the reference track.  \n4.2.4. Range Compression \nEach 1Hz frame of the AltiKa Ka band range measurement (see range parameter) is derived from \nthe linear regression of the respective valid 40 Hz range measurements (see range_40hz \nparameter).  \nAn iterative outlier detection scheme is adopted in this linear regression and the resulting 40 Hz \nmeasurements are identified by setting the corresponding bit in the parameters (range_used_40hz) \nto 1. Measurements not considered as outliers have the parameters (range_used_40hz) set to 0. \nThe number of valid 40 Hz measurements that are used to derive each of the 1 Hz measurements is \nprovided on the (O)(I)GDRs (see range_numval parameter), as are the root-mean-square of the \ndifferences between the valid 40 Hz measurements and the derived 1 Hz measurement (see \nrange_rms parameter). \nSpecialized applications, such as over land, ice, lakes or rivers, may require that the users perform \ntheir own compression algorithm on the 40 Hz measurements.  \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n52 \n \n \n \n5. Altimetric data \nThis section presents a short discussion of the main quantities on the (O)(I)GDR.  \nAn excellent overview of the theoretical and practical effects of radar altimetry is the “Satellite \nAltimetry” Chapter by Chelton et al [2001].  \n5.1. Precise Orbits \nCNES has the responsibility for producing the orbit ephemeris for the SARAL/AltiKa data products. \nThe SARAL/AltiKa OGDRs provide a navigator orbit that has radial accuracies better than 30 cm \n(rms), the IGDRs provide a preliminary orbit that has radial accuracies better than 4 cm (rms), \nwhile the GDRs provide a precise orbit that has radial accuracies better than 3 cm (rms). \n5.2. Altimeter Range \nAn altimeter operates by sending out a short pulse of radiation and measuring the time required for \nthe pulse to return from the sea surface. This measurement, called the altimeter range, gives the \ndistance between the instrument and the sea surface, provided that the velocity of the propagation \nof the pulse and the precise arrival time are known. The mono frequency altimeter on SARAL/AltiKa \nperforms only range measurements at Ka band frequencies (see range parameter).  \nThe range reported on the SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR has already been corrected for a variety of \ncalibration and instrument effects, including calibration errors, pointing angle errors, center of \ngravity motion, and terms related to the altimeter acceleration such as Doppler shift and oscillator \ndrift. The sum total of these corrections also appears on the (O)(I)GDR for Ka band range (see \nnet_instr_corr_range parameter).  \n5.3. Geoid \nThe geoid is an equipotential surface of the Earth's gravity field that is closely associated with the \nlocation of the mean sea surface. The reference ellipsoid is a bi-axial ellipsoid of revolution. The \ncenter of the ellipsoid is ideally at the center of mass of the Earth although the center is usually \nplaced at the origin of the reference frame in which a satellite orbit is calculated and tracking \nstation positions given. The separation between the geoid and the reference ellipsoid is the geoid \nundulation (see geoid parameter).  \nThe geoid undulation, over the entire Earth, has a root mean square value of 30.6 m with extreme \nvalues of approximately 83 m and -106 m. Although the geoid undulations are primarily long \nwavelength phenomena, short wavelength changes in the geoid undulation are seen over \nseamounts, trenches, ridges, etc., in the oceans. The calculation of a high resolution geoid requires \nhigh resolution surface gravity data in the region of interest as well as a potential coefficient model \nthat can be used to define the long and medium wavelengths of the Earth's gravitational field. \nSurface gravity data are generally only available in certain regions of the Earth and spherical \nharmonic expansions of the Earth's gravitational potential are usually used to define the geoid \nglobally. Currently, such expansions are available to degree 360 and in some cases higher.  \nFor ocean circulation studies, it is important that the long wavelength part of the geoid be \naccurately determined.  \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n53 \n \n \n \n5.4. Mean Sea Surface \nA Mean Sea Surface (MSS) represents the position of the ocean surface averaged over an appropriate \ntime period to remove annual, semi-annual, seasonal, and spurious sea surface height signals. A MSS \nis given as a grid with spacing consistent with the altimeter and other data used in the generation \nof the grid values. The MSS grid can be useful for data editing purposes, for the calculation of along \ntrack and cross track geoid gradients, for the calculation of gridded gravity anomalies, for \ngeophysical studies, for a reference surface to which sea surface height data from different \naltimeter missions can be reduced, etc. The SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR provides a global MSS model \nthat is generated from multiple satellite altimetry missions (see mean_sea_surface parameter). \nLonger time spans of data that become available in the future, along with improved data handling \ntechniques will improve the current MSS models. Care must be given to the retention of high \nfrequency signal and the reduction of high frequency noise.  \n5.5. Mean Dynamic Topography \nA Mean Dynamic Topography (MDT) represents the Mean Sea Surface referenced to a geoid and \ncorrected from geophysical effects. A MDT is given as a grid with spacing consistent with the \naltimeter and other data used in the generation of the grid values. The MDT provides the absolute \nreference surface for the ocean circulation. The SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR provides a global MDT \nmodel (see mean_topography parameter) that is a combined product recovering several years based \non GRACE mission, altimetry and in situ data (hydrologic and drifters data). \n5.6. Geophysical Corrections \nThe atmosphere and ionosphere slow the velocity of radio pulses at a rate proportional to the total \nmass of the atmosphere, the mass of water vapor in the atmosphere, and the number of free \nelectrons in the ionosphere. In addition, radio pulses do not reflect from the mean sea level but \nfrom a level that depends on wave height and wind speed. The errors due to these processes cannot \nbe ignored and must be removed. Discussions of these effects are given in Chelton et al. [2001].  \n5.6.1. Dry Troposphere  \nThe propagation velocity of a radio pulse is slowed by the \"dry\" gases and the quantity of water \nvapor in the Earth's troposphere. The \"dry\" gas contribution is nearly constant and produces height \nerrors of approximately -2.3 m. The water vapor in the troposphere is quite variable and \nunpredictable and produces a height calculation error of -6 cm to -40 cm. However, these effects \ncan be measured or modeled as discussed below.  \nThe gases in the troposphere contribute to the index of refraction. In detail, the refractive index \ndepends on pressure and temperature. When hydrostatic equilibrium and the ideal gas law are \nassumed, the vertically integrated range delay is a function only of the surface pressure, see \nChelton et al. [2001]. The dry meteorological tropospheric range correction is principally equal to \nthe surface pressure multiplied by -2.277mm/mbar, with a small adjustment also necessary to \nreflect a small latitude dependence (see model_dry_tropo_corr parameter).  \nmodel_dry_tropo_corr = \n[\n]\nphi)\ncos(2\n \n \n0.0026\n \n 1\nP\n-2.277\natm\n∗\n∗\n+\n∗\n∗\n \nwhere Patm is surface atmospheric pressure in mbar, phi is latitude, and model_dry_tropo_corr is \nthe dry troposphere correction in mm. There is no straightforward way of measuring the nadir \nsurface pressure from a satellite, so it is determined from the European Center for Medium Range \nWeather Forecasting (ECMWF) numerical weather prediction model using the surface pressure \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n54 \n \n \n \nfields. For OGDR processing, predicted ECMWF Psurf fields are used and for (I)GDR processing \nanalyzed fields are used.  \n5.6.2. Wet Troposphere \nThe amount of water vapor present along the path length contributes to the index of refraction of \nthe Earth's atmosphere. Its contribution to the delay of the radio pulse, the wet tropospheric delay, \ncan be estimated by measuring the atmospheric brightness near the water vapor line at 22.2356 \nGHz and providing suitable removal of the background. The SARAL/AltiKa dual frequency \nradiometer measures the brightness temperatures in the nadir path at 23.8 and 37.0 GHz: the water \nvapor signal is sensed by the 23.8 GHz channel, while the 37 GHz channel removes other \natmospheric contributions (surface emission, cloud cover influence) [Keihm et al., 1995]. \nMeasurements are combined to obtain the path delay in the satellite range measurement due to the \nwater vapor content (see rad_wet_tropo_corr parameter).  \nThe ECMWF numerical weather prediction model provides also a value for the wet tropospheric \ndelay. An interpolated value from this model is included in the (O)(I)GDR, as a backup to the \nmeasurement from the radiometer (see model_wet_tropo_corr parameter). This backup will prove \nuseful when sun glint, land contamination, or anomalous sensor behavior makes the radiometer \nmeasurement of the wet tropospheric delay unusable. \nThe ECMWF meteorological fields are interpolated to provide the model dry and wet tropospheric \ncorrections at the time and location of the altimeter measurement (see model_dry_tropo_corr and \nmodel_wet_tropo_corr) and an interpolation quality flag is provided on the (O)(I)GDR to indicate \nthe quality of this interpolation (see interp_flag_meteo).  \n5.6.3. Ionosphere \nThe group velocity of the altimeter radar pulses is slowed by the presence of free electrons in the \nEarth’s ionospheric layer. As the Total Electronic Content (TEC) is highly variable in time (diurnal, \nseasonal, solar cycle variations) and in space (latitude dependent), accurate measurement of the \nresulting delay requires generally fine sampling coincident with the radar measurements. The \nionospheric dispersion being linear, the delay is usually computed by combining the dual-frequency \nmeasurements of the radar altimeter (e.g. for T/P, Jason-1 and 2 : Ku and C bands).  \nIn the case of AltiKa, only one frequency is available (Ka), which prevents from using such a \nclassical dual frequency approach. However, it is shown that ionosphere correction (= 40300 x TEC / \nfrequency²) is an order of magnitude smaller in Ka-band than in Ku-band (actually divided by 7). For \namplitudes of the ionosphere correction in Ku-band in the range 2-25 cm, equivalent effect in Ka-\nband is only 0.3-3.6 cm.  \nThus, for AltiKa, external ancillary data are used to compute ionosphere correction, in the form of \nTEC grids computed from GPS-based observations and ionosphere model (the JPL Global Ionosphere \nMaps – GIM – model). Other auxiliary data such as solar activity coefficients (within IRI95) are used \nto correct the satellite altitude. \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n55 \n \n \n \n \nFigure 16. Example of Global Ionosphere Maps from JPL \nGIM model has been validated through comparisons with T/P, Jason-1, Jason-2 and ENVISAT dual \nfrequency ionosphere corrections.  \nAs GIM fields are distributed with a 24 hours latency, the correct fields will not be available on time \nfor OGDR processing. In that case, the last GIM field available will be used, as well as an \nextrapolated MOE orbit, in order to compute in advance the ionosphere correction for OGDR. \nThe ionospheric GIM correction solution may be used over non ocean surfaces (ice, land, etc.). \n5.6.4. Ocean Waves (sea state bias) \nUnlike the preceding effects, sea-state effects are an intrinsic property of the large footprint radar \nmeasurements. The surface scattering elements do not contribute equally to the radar return; \ntroughs of waves tend to reflect altimeter pulses better than do crests. Thus the centroid of the \nmean reflecting surface is shifted away from mean sea level towards the troughs of the waves. The \nshift, referred to as the electromagnetic (EM) bias, causes the altimeter to overestimate the range \n(see Rodriguez et al., [1992]). In addition, a skewness bias also exists from the assumption in the \nonboard algorithms that the probability density function of heights is symmetric, while in reality it \nis skewed. Finally, there is a tracker bias, which is a purely instrumental effect. The sum of EM \nbias, skewness bias, and tracker bias is called 'sea state bias' (see sea_state_bias parameter). \nThe accuracy of sea state bias models remains limited and continues to be a topic of research. The \ncurrent most accurate estimates are obtained using empirical models derived from analyses of the \naltimeter data. The sea state bias is computed from a bilinear interpolation of a table of sea state \nbiases versus significant wave height and wind speed, based on empirical fits (Labroue [2004]). \n \nNevertheless all these works are done for Ku and C band so at the beginning of the mission, the SSB \nwill be estimated at 3.5% of SWH and an empirical model will be computed using at least one year \nof SARAL/AltiKa data.  \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n56 \n \n \n \n5.7. Trailing edge variation flag \n5.7.1. Introduction : Rain & Cloud effect on SARAL/Altika \nKa-band is highly sensitive to rainy and cloudy conditions. It means that an overall assessment of \nrain effect on SARAL/AltiKa data availability and quality should be performed during the \nverification phase in order to monitor global percentage and spatio-temporal evolution of lost data \ndue to rain and cloud effect, and thus give a consolidated budget for data loss due to rain \nattenuation and waveform distortion.  \nAttenuation by rain is expected to be much more significant at Ka-band than Ku-band, although \neven in the tropics, actual data loss is only expected to be 5-10% (Tournadre et al., 2009). \nHowever, the reliable detection and flagging of rain-contaminated data is important for the quality \nof the overall altimeter product. \n5.7.2. SARAL/AltiKa Trailing edge variation flag \nDue to the mono-frequency characteristic of the SARAL/AltiKa altimeter, the rain flags used for T/P \nand Jason-1&2 altimeters can not be used as they rely on the differential attenuation by rain of the \nsignal at Ku and C band. Furthermore, the use of Ka band implies that not only rain can significantly \nalter the altimeter measurement but also dense cloud, that is why we prefer using “trailing edge \nvariation effect” instead of “rain effect”.  \nA new “trailing edge variation flag” based on the analysis of the along-track variation of the off-\nnadir angle estimate (the so-called “Matching Pursuit” algorithm) has been defined and tested using \nJason-1 data (Tournadre et al., 2009) and will be used operationally to detect the data potentially \naffected by atmospheric liquid water. This new approach to altimeter data rain flagging has to be \nvalidated and calibrated during the commissioning phase. \n5.7.3. Limitations \nPlease note that the trailing_edge_variation_flag parameter should be used carefully. In fact, as \nmentioned above, this flag detects surfaces changes caused by rain, sigma-blooms, cloud, etc. The \nmeaning of the flag is: non short scale variation/short scale variation. To be considered only as a \nrain flag users should correlate this flag with water vapor content or liquid water content (see \nrad_water_vapor and rad_liquid_water parameter). These auxiliary information come from the \nradiometer measurements. Thresholds for these auxiliary parameters should be defined and \nprovided during commissioning phase. \n5.8. Ice Flag \nThe range measurement from the altimeter is likely to have larger errors when the pulse is \nreflected off ice surfaces. The ice surface is not at sea level, but at some unknown distance above \nit. For this reason the SARAL/ALTIKA (O)(I)GDR provides an ice flag (see ice_flag parameter) to \nindicate when the data point is likely to be over ice. \nThe ice flag is set if the absolute value of the difference between the model wet tropospheric \ncorrection and the dual frequency wet tropospheric correction retrieved from 23.8 GHz and 37.0 \nGHz brightness temperatures exceeds a specified threshold, OR if the number of valid 40-Hz \naltimeter range of the processed measurement is smaller than a specified threshold. If the \ncorresponding computations cannot be performed, then the ice flag is set if a climatological map \npredicts ice at the given location, and if the wind speed derived from the altimeter measurement is \nless than 1 m/s, i.e., the backscatter is larger than normally expected from the ocean.  \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n57 \n \n \n \nDisclaimer: Users are advised to use this flag carefully because it is linked to conditions relative \nto altimeter wind speed (derived from sigma naught values). As it was not possible to assess \nprecisely the sigma naught before launch, all derived parameters may not be representative \nand are subject to tuning at the beginning of the mission.   \n5.9. Tides \nTides are a significant contributor to the observed sea surface height [LeProvost, 2001]. While they \nare of interest in themselves, they have more variation than all other time-varying ocean signals. \nSince they are highly predictable, they are removed from the data in order to study ocean \ncirculation.  \nThere are several contributions to the tidal effect: the ocean tide, the load tide, the solid earth \ntide and the pole tide. The ocean tide, load tide and solid earth tide are all related to luni-solar \nforcing of the earth, either directly as is the case of the ocean and solid earth tide, or indirectly as \nis the case with the load tide since it is forced by the ocean tide. The pole tide is due to variations \nin the earth’s rotation and is unrelated to luni-solar forcing.  \nSARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDRs do not explicitly provide values for the pure ocean tide, but instead \nprovide values for a quantity referred to as the geocentric ocean tide, which is the sum total of the \nocean tide and the load tide. Values of the load tide that were used to compute the geocentric \nocean tide are also explicitly provided, so the pure ocean tide can be determined by subtracting \nthe load tide value from the geocentric ocean tide value. Note that the permanent tide is not \nincluded in either the geocentric ocean tide or solid earth tide corrections that are provided on the \nSARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDRs. \n5.9.1. Geocentric Ocean Tide \nAs mentioned above, the geocentric ocean tide is a quantity sometimes used to refer to the sum \ntotal of the ocean tide and the load tide. The SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR provides two choices for the \ngeocentric ocean tide, ocean_tide_sol1 and ocean_tide_sol2, each of which is computed as the sum \ntotal of the diurnal and semidiurnal ocean and load tides as predicted by a particular model, and an \nequilibrium representation of the long-period ocean tides at all periods except for the zero \nfrequency (constant) term. The two load tide values provided on the GDR, load_tide_sol1 and \nload_tide_sol2, provide the respective load tide values that were used to compute ocean_tide_sol1 \nand ocean_tide_sol2. \n5.9.2. Long period Ocean Tide \nThe long-period ocean tides are a subject of continuing investigation. To first order, they can be \napproximated by an equilibrium representation. However, the true long-period ocean tide response \nis thought to have departures from an equilibrium response that increase with decreasing period. \nThe two principal long-period ocean tide components, Mf and Mm, with fortnightly and monthly \nperiods respectively, are known to have departures from an equilibrium response with magnitudes \nless than 1-2 cm. \nThe SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR explicitly provides a value for an equilibrium representation of the \nlong-period ocean tide that includes all long-period tidal components excluding the permanent tide \n(zero frequency) component (see parameter ocean_tide_equil). Note that both geocentric ocean \ntide values on the (O)(I)GDR (ocean_tide_sol1 and ocean_tide_sol2) already include the equilibrium \nlong-period ocean tide and should therefore not be used simultaneously. \n \nThe SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR provides a parameter for a non-equilibrium representation of the long-\nperiod ocean tides (see parameter ocean_tide_non_equil). This parameter is provided as a \ncorrection to the equilibrium long-period ocean tide model so that the total non-equilibrium long \nperiod ocean tide is formed as a sum of ocean_tide_equil and ocean_tide_non_equil. \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n58 \n \n \n \n5.9.3. Solid Earth Tide \nThe solid Earth responds to external gravitational forces similarly to the oceans. The response of \nthe Earth is fast enough that it can be considered to be in equilibrium with the tide generating \nforces. Then, the surface is parallel with the equipotential surface, and the tide height is \nproportional to the potential. The two proportionality constants are the so-called Love numbers. It \nshould be noted that the Love numbers are largely frequency independent, an exception occurs \nnear a frequency corresponding to the K1 tide constituents due to a resonance in the liquid core \n[Wahr, 1985 and Stacey, 1977].  \nThe SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR computes the solid earth tide, or body tide, as a purely radial elastic \nresponse of the solid Earth to the tidal potential (see parameter solid_earth_tide.) The adopted \ntidal potential is the Cartwright and Tayler [1971] and Cartwright and Edden [1973] tidal potential \nextrapolated to the 2000 era, and includes degree 2 and 3 coefficients of the tidal potential. The \npermanent tide (zero frequency) term is excluded from the tidal potential that is used to compute \nthe solid earth tide parameter for the SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR. The elastic response is modeled \nusing frequency independent Love numbers. The effects of the resonance in the core are accounted \nfor by scaling the tide potential amplitude of the K1 tidal coefficient and some neighboring nodal \nterms by an appropriate scale factor.  \n5.9.4. Pole Tide \nThe pole tide is a tide-like motion of the ocean surface that is a response of both the solid Earth \nand the oceans to the centrifugal potential that is generated by small perturbations to the Earth's \nrotation axis. These perturbations primarily occur at periods of 433 days (called the Chandler \nwobble) and annual. These periods are long enough for the pole tide displacement to be considered \nto be in equilibrium with the forcing centrifugal potential. The SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR provides a \nsingle field for the radial geocentric pole tide displacement of the ocean surface (see pole_tide \nparameter), and includes the radial pole tide displacement of the solid Earth and the oceans.  \nThe pole tide is easily computed as described in Wahr [1985]. Modeling the pole tide requires \nknowledge of proportionality constants, the so-called Love numbers, and a time series of \nperturbations to the Earth's rotation axis, a quantity that is now measured routinely with space \ntechniques. Note that the pole tide on the IGDR and GDR may differ, since the pole tide on the GDR \nis computed with a more accurate time series of the Earth's rotation axis. \n5.10. Inverse Barometer Effect \n5.10.1. Inverted Barometer Correction \nAs atmospheric pressure increases and decreases, the sea surface tends to respond hydrostatically, \nfalling or rising respectively. Generally, a 1-mbar increase in atmospheric pressure depresses the \nsea surface by about 1 cm. This effect is referred to as the inverse barometer (IB) effect. \nThe instantaneous IB effect on sea surface height in millimeters (see parameter inv_bar_corr) is \ncomputed from the surface atmospheric pressure, Patm in mbar:  \ninv_bar_corr = \nP)\n - \n(P\n-9.948\natm\n∗\n \nwhere P is the time varying mean of the global surface atmospheric pressure over the oceans.  \nThe scale factor 9.948 is based on the empirical value [Wunsch, 1972] of the IB response at mid \nlatitudes. Some researchers use other values. Note that the surface atmospheric pressure is also \nproportional to the dry tropospheric correction, and so the parameter inv_bar_corr approximately \nchanges by 4 to 5 mm as model_dry_tropo_corr changes by 1 mm (assuming a constant mean global \nsurface pressure). The uncertainty of the ECMWF atmospheric pressure products is somewhat \ndependent on location. Typical errors vary from 1 mbar in the northern Atlantic Ocean to a few \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n59 \n \n \n \nmbars in the southern Pacific Ocean. A 1-mbar error in pressure translates into a 10 mm error in the \ncomputation of the IB effect. \nNote that the time varying mean global pressure over the oceans, P, during the first eight years of \nthe T/P mission had a mean value of approximately 1010.9 mbar, with an annual variation around \nthis mean of approximately 0.6 mbar. However, the T/P data products provided a static inverse \nbarometer correction referenced to a constant mean pressure of 1013.3 mbar. \nIB(T/P) = \n1013.3)\n - \n(P\n-9.948\natm\n∗\n \nSea surface heights that are generated after applying an inverse barometer correction referenced \nto a mean pressure of 1013.3 mbar are therefore approximately -9.948*(1010.9-1013.3) = 23.9 mm \nlower than those that are generated after applying an inverse barometer correction referenced to a \ntime varying global mean pressure, and the difference between the two sea surface heights has an \nannual variation of approximately 9.948*0.6 = 6 mm.  \n5.10.2. Barotropic/Baroclinic Response to Atmospheric Forcing \nThe High Frequency Wind and Pressure Response correction, hf_fluctuations_corr, complements the \nInverted Barometer (IB) correction. Like both tides and IB, the ocean response to wind and pressure \n(after removing the IB part) has energy at periods higher than the 20 day implied by the 35-day \nrepeat cycle of SARAL/AltiKa. This correction can be thought of as a departure from the IB response \nto pressure, although strictly it is the difference between the response to wind and pressure minus \nthe IB. Ali and Zlotnicki [2000] compute this response with a barotropic model that is forced by \nNCEP operational wind and pressure. The model output is filtered in time to pass frequencies \nshorter than 20 days. See also Stammer et al. [1999] and Tierney et al. [2000]. \nThe parameter hf_fluctuations_corr is provided in the (I)GDR products as a correction to the inverse \nbarometer correction inv_bar_corr. \n5.11. Sigma 0 \nThe backscatter coefficient, sigma0 Ka values (see parameters sig0), reported on the (O)(I)GDR are \ncorrected for atmospheric attenuation using atmos_corr_sig0. Note that \"unbiased\" sigma0 values \nare recorded on the SARAL/AltiKa data products. For some geophysical algorithms, an appropriate \nbias is applied to the provided sigma. These biases have been determined from comparisons to \nJason-1 or Jason-2 sigma0. \nDisclaimer : the SARAL altimeter use a Ka band which is new for nadir altimeter. It is worth \nrecalling that Ka band is highly sensitive to the rain and cloud attenuation. It was  not possible \nto assess precisely the impact on the sigma naught before launch. User are so advised to use \nthis parameter with care.  \n \n5.12. Wind Speed \nThe model functions developed to date for altimeter wind speed have all been purely empirical. \nThe model function establishes a relation between the wind speed, and the sea surface backscatter \ncoefficient and significant wave height. A wind speed is calculated through a mathematical \nrelationship with the Ka-band backscatter coefficient and the significant wave height (see \nwind_speed_alt) using the Gourrion algorithm. The wind speed model function is evaluated for 10 \nmeter above the sea surface, and is considered to be accurate to 2 m/s. \n \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n60 \n \n \n \nDisclaimer : Users should use this parameter carefully because the altimeter wind speed \nalgorithm has been tuned on Jason-1 data and should be recalculated with at least one year of \nSARAL/Altika data. \n \nA 10-meter (above surface) wind vector (in east-west and north-south directions) is also provided on \nthe SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR (see parameters wind_speed_model_u and wind_speed_model_v). This \nwind speed vector is determined from an interpolation of the ECMWF model. The best accuracy for \nthe wind vector varies from about 2 m/s in magnitude and 20 degrees in direction in the northern \nAtlantic Ocean, to more then 5 m/s and 40 degrees in the southern Pacific Ocean. \n5.13. Bathymetry Information \nThe SARAL/AltiKa (O)(I)GDR provides a parameter bathymetry that gives the ocean depth or land \nelevation of the data point. Ocean depths have negative values, and land elevations have positive \nvalues. This parameter is given to allow users to make their own \"cut\" for ocean depth.  \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n61 \n \n \n \n6.

Data format \nSARAL/AltiKa OGDR, IGDR and GDR products have the same information and format. The only \ndifference is related to the auxiliary data used (orbit, meteo files, calibrations, … ). \nAccounting for Jason-2 heritage, products are split into three data sets : \n• \n“SSHA” data set : One file close to Jason-2 NRT-SSHA, limited to 1Hz sampling values \n• \n“GDR” data set : One file close to Jason-2 IGDR, containing 1Hz and 40Hz values  \n• \n“SGDR” data set : One file close to Jason-2 SGDR, containing 1Hz, 40hz and waveforms \nvalues \nThe following figure shows the data sets available for each kind of product.  \nOGDR Product\n“SSHA”\nDataSet\n“GDR”\nDataSet\n“SGDR”\nDataSet\nIGDR and GDR Products\nOGDR Product\n“SSHA”\nDataSet\n“GDR”\nDataSet\n“SGDR”\nDataSet\nIGDR and GDR Products\n \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n63 \n \n \n \nFigure 17 : Data set availability per product \n \n \n6.1.1. NetCdf format and CF convention \n \nThe netCDF data format has been chosen to store the different data sets (one file per data set). \nThis format is extremely flexible, self describing and has been adopted as a de-facto standard for \nmany operational oceanography systems. What’s more, the files follow the Climate and Forecast \nNetCDF conventions CF-1.1 because these conventions provide a practical standard for storing. \n6.1.2. The NetCDF Data Model \nA netCDF file contains dimensions, variables, and attributes, which all have both a name by which \nthey are identified. These components can be used together to capture the meaning of data and \nrelations among data fields in an array-oriented data set. \n6.1.2.1. Dimensions \nA dimension may be used to represent a real physical dimension, for example, time, latitude, \nlongitude, or height. A dimension might also be used to index other quantities (waveforms index for \nexample). The following dimensions are used in the SARAL/AltiKa product files: \n \nDimension \nName \nValue \nSSHA \nData Set \nGDR \nData Set \nSGDR \nData Set \ntime \nNumber of measurements in the file \nX \nX \nX \nmeas_ind \n40 (number of elementary measurements) \n \nX \nX \nwvf_ind \n128 (number of waveform samples) \n \n \nX \nTable 15 - Dimensions used in the SARAL/AltiKa data sets \n6.1.2.2. Variables \nVariables are used to store the bulk of the data in a netCDF file. A variable represents an array of \nvalues of the same type. A scalar value is treated as a 0-dimensional array. A variable has a name, a \ndata type, and a shape described by its list of dimensions specified when the variable is created. A \nvariable may also have associated attributes, which may be added, deleted or changed after the \nvariable is created. \nA variable data type is one of a small set of netCDF types. In this document the variable types will \nbe represent as follows: \n \nVariable type \nDescription \nchar \ncharacters \nbyte \n8-bit data signed \nshort \n16-bit signed integer \nint \n32-bit signed integer \nfloat \nIEEE single precision floating point (32 bits) \ndouble \nIEEE double precision floating point (64 bits) \nTable 16 - netCDF variable type \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n64 \n \n \n \n6.1.2.3. Coordinate variables and auxiliary coordinate variables \nA variable with the same name as a dimension is called a coordinate variable. It typically defines a \nphysical coordinate corresponding to that dimension. In accordance with the Climate and Forecast \nconventions, we must declare a coordinate variable for each dimension. What’s more, missing \nvalues are not allowed in coordinate variables and they must be strictly monotonic. \nAn auxiliary coordinate variable is a netCDF variable that contains coordinates data but is not a \ncoordinate variable as defined above. Unlike coordinate variables, there is no relationship between \nthe name of an auxiliary coordinate variable and the name(s) of its dimension(s). \n6.1.2.4. Attributes \nNetCDF attributes are used to store data about the data (ancillary data or metadata), similar in \nmany ways to the information stored in data dictionaries and schema in conventional database \nsystems. Most attributes provide information about a specific variable. These are identified by the \nname of that variable, together with the name of the attribute. \nSome attributes provide information about the data set as a whole. They are called global \nattributes - similar to the header of the Jason-1 products. \nThe following table shows the variable attributes used in the SARAL/AltiKa product. There are no \nmandatory attributes. \n \nAttribute \nDescription \n_FillValue \nA default value used to represent missing or undefined data \nadd_offset \nIf present, this number is to be added to the data after it is read by an application.

The netCDF \nutility ncdump converts netCDF objects binary to CDL text. The netCDF utility ncgen creates \nnetCDF binary file from CDL text file. \nA CDL description of a netCDF data set takes the form: \nnetCDF name { \n dimension: … \n variables: … \n data: … \n} \n \nwhere the name is used only as a default in constructing file names by the ncgen utility. The CDL \ndescription consists of three optional parts, introduced by the keywords dimensions variables and \ndata. NetCDF dimension declarations appear after the dimensions keyword, netCDF variables and \nattributes are defined after the variables keyword and variable data assignments appears after the \ndata keyword. CDL statement are terminated by a semicolon. Spaces, tabs and newlines can be \nused freely for readability. Comments in CDL follow the characters ‘//’ on any line. \nExample  \n \nnetcdf example { \ndimensions: \n \ntime = 3213 ; \n \n \n//  dimensions name are declared first \n \nmeas_ind = 40 ; \nvariables: \n \ndouble time(time) ; \n \n \n// variable <type> <name>(<dimension>) \n \n \ntime:long_name = \"time (sec. since 2000-01-01)\" ; // variable attributes \n \n \ntime:standard_name = \"time\" ; \n \n \ntime:calendar = \"gregorian\" ; \n \n \ntime:tai_utc_difference = -34. ; \n \n \ntime:leap_second = \"0000-00-00 00:00:00\" ; \n \n \ntime:units = \"seconds since 2000-01-01 00:00:00.0\" ; \n \n \ntime:comment = \"[tai_utc_difference] is the difference between TAI and UTC reference \ntime (seconds) for the first measurement of the data set.

Software \nThis section lists some software that may be used to browse and use data from SSHA, GDR and SGDR \ndata sets. \n6.4.1. Software provided with netCDF : “ncdump” \n « ncdump » converts netCDF files to ASCII form (CDL) \nSee http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/ncdump-man-1.html \nThe main options are the following : \n-h  \nShow only the header information in the output, that is the declarations of \ndimensions, variables, and attributes but no data values for any variables \n-c  \nShow the values of coordinate variables (variables that are also dimensions) as \nwell as the declarations of all dimensions, variables, and attribute values \n-v var1,...,varn  The output will include data values for the specified variables, in addition to \nthe declarations of all dimensions, variables, and attributes \n-x var1,...,varn  Output XML (NcML) instead of CDL. The NcML does not include data values \n6.4.2. Additional general software \n6.4.2.1. ncbrowse \n“ncBrowse” is a Java application that provides flexible, interactive graphical displays of data and \nattributes from a wide range of netCDF data file conventions. \nSee http://www.epic.noaa.gov/java/ncBrowse/ \n6.4.2.2. netCDF Operator (NCO) \nThe netCDF Operators, or “NCO”, are a suite of programs known as operators. Each operator is a \nstandalone, command line program which is executed at the UNIX shell-level, like, e.g., ls or \nmkdir. The operators take netCDF files as input, then perform a set of operations (e.g., deriving \nnew data, averaging, hyperslabbing, or metadata manipulation) and produce a netCDF file as \noutput. The operators are primarily designed to aid manipulation and analysis of gridded scientific \ndata. The single command style of NCO allows users to manipulate and analyze files interactively \nand with simple scripts, avoiding the overhead (and some of the power) of a higher level \nprogramming environment. \nSee http://nco.sourceforge.net/ \n6.4.3.  Additional specific software : “BRAT” \nThe “Basic Radar Altimetry Toolbox” is a collection of tools and tutorial documents designed to \nfacilitate the use of radar altimetry data. It is able to read most distributed radar altimetry data \nfrom all the satellites, to do some processing, data editing and statistic over them, and to visualise \nthe results. The Basic Radar Altimetry Toolbox is able to read ERS-1 and 2, TOPEX/Poseidon, \nGEOSAT Follow-on, Jason-1, Jason-2, ENVISAT, SARAL/AltiKa and CRYOSAT-2 missions altimetry \ndata from official data centers (ESA, NASA/JPL, CNES/AVISO, NOAA, ISRO), and this for different \nprocessing levels, from level 1B (Sensor Geophysical Data Record) to level 3/4 (gridded merged \ndata).  \nSee http://www.altimetry.info/html/data/toolbox_en.html.  \n \n \nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook  \n \nIss :1.2 - date : December 12, 2011 \n71 \n \n \n \nAnnexe A -  References \nBenada, J.

INTRODUCTION \nThe aim of this document is to define the SARAL Level 2 altimeter products specifications. It is applicable to \nthe development of the processing module (SPA, TM_NRT) and of the other tools developed by 3 partners \n(BUFR convertor, …). Document AD 2 gives complementary information to users. \nAccording to requirements from AD 1, three different data products shall be produced and distributed to the \nusers: \n1. Operational Geophysical Data Record (OGDR) produced in near real time  \n2. Interim Geophysical Data Record (IGDR) produced in 1 to 1.5 days  \n3. Geophysical Data Record (GDR) produced in 60 days  \nThe first one is a NRT product. The other two are OFL products. \nIn addition to the native NetCdf format which is described in this document, a 1Hz BUFR-formatted dataset \nfrom the OGDR family (OGDR-BUFR) for distribution via the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) \nGlobal Tele-communication System (GTS) and EUMETCast is also generated. The BUFR format is \ndescribed in AD 2.  \nNetcdf OGDR/IGDR/GDR products will have the same information and format. The only difference will be \nrelated to auxiliary data (orbit, meteo files, calibrations, … ). \nTaken into account Jason-1/2 heritage, products will be split into several data sets : \n1. One “reduced” file, close to the current Jason-1/2 NRT-SSHA, limited to 1 Hz sampling \n2. One “standard” file, close to the current Jason-1/2 I/GDR, containing 1 Hz and 40 Hz values \n3. One “expertise” file, close to the current Jason-1/2 SGDR, containing 1 Hz, 40 Hz and waveforms \nvalues. This file will not be generated in NRT. \nThe following table shows the data sets available for each kind of product.  \n \n \nData set \n \n \nReduced \nStandard \nExpertise \nOGDR \nX \nX \n \nIGDR \nX \nX \nX \n \nProducts \nGDR \nX \nX \nX \nTable 1 – Data set availability per product \nAn overview of the file format used for the data sets is given in section 2. Then the data sets are described \nfrom section 3 to section 6. \n \nReference:  \nSALP-ST-M-EA-15839-CN \nVersion :  \n2.2 \nDate :  \nFebruary, 17th 2012 \nPage:  \n8/47 \nSALP Products Specification – Volume 20 : AltiKa / SARAL User Products \n \n2. SARAL PRODUCTS OVERVIEW \n \n2.1. \nNETCDF FORMAT AND CF CONVENTION \n \nThe NetCDF data format has been chosen to store the different data sets (one file per data set). This format \nis extremely flexible, self describing and has been adopted as a de-facto standard for many operational \noceanography systems. What’s more, the files will follow the Climate and Forecast NetCDF conventions CF-\n1.1 because these conventions provide a practical standard for storing. \n2.2. \nTHE NETCDF DATA MODEL \nA NetCDF file contains dimensions, variables, and attributes, which all have both a name by which they are \nidentified. These components can be used together to capture the meaning of data and relations among \ndata fields in an array-oriented data set. \n2.2.1. \nDIMENSIONS \nA dimension may be used to represent a real physical dimension, for example, time, latitude, longitude, or \nheight. A dimension might also be used to index other quantities (waveforms index for example). The \nfollowing dimensions are used in the SARAL product files: \n \n \n \nData set \nDimension \nname \nValue \nReduced \nStandard \nExpertise \ntime \nNumber of measurements in the file \nYes \nYes \nYes \nmeas_ind \n40 (number of elementary \nmeasurements) \nNo \nYes \nYes \nwvf_ind \n128 (number of waveform samples) \nNo \nNo \nYes \nTable 2 - Dimensions used in the SARAL data sets \n2.2.2. \nVARIABLES \nVariables are used to store the bulk of the data in a netCDF file. A variable represents an array of values of \nthe same type. A scalar value is treated as a 0-dimensional array. A variable has a name, a data type, and a \nshape described by its list of dimensions specified when the variable is created. A variable may also have \nassociated attributes, which may be added, deleted or changed after the variable is created. \nA variable data type is one of a small set of netCDF types. In this document the variable types will be \nrepresented as follows: \n \n \nReference:  \nSALP-ST-M-EA-15839-CN \nVersion :  \n2.2 \nDate :  \nFebruary, 17th 2012 \nPage:  \n9/47 \nSALP Products Specification – Volume 20 : AltiKa / SARAL User Products \n \nVariable type \nDescription \nchar \ncharacters \nbyte \n8-bit data signed \nshort \n16-bit signed integer \nint \n32-bit signed integer \nfloat \nIEEE single precision floating point (32 bits) \ndouble \nIEEE double precision floating point (64 bits) \nTable 3 - netCDF variable type \n2.2.3. \nCOORDINATE VARIABLES AND AUXILIARY COORDINATE VARIABLES \nA variable with the same name as a dimension is called a coordinate variable. It typically defines a physical \ncoordinate corresponding to that dimension. In accordance with the Climate and Forecast conventions, we \nmust declare a coordinate variable for each dimension. What’s more, missing values are not allowed in \ncoordinate variables and they must be strictly monotonic. \nAn auxiliary coordinate variable is a netCDF variable that contains coordinates data but is not a coordinate \nvariable as defined above. Unlike coordinate variables, there is no relationship between the name of an \nauxiliary coordinate variable and the name(s) of its dimension(s). \n2.2.4. \nATTRIBUTES \nNetCDF attributes are used to store data about the data (ancillary data or metadata), similar in many ways to \nthe information stored in data dictionaries and schema in conventional database systems. Most attributes \nprovide information about a specific variable. These are identified by the name of that variable, together with \nthe name of the attribute. \nSome attributes provide information about the data set as a whole. They are called global attributes. \nThe following table shows the variable attributes used in the SARAL product. There are no mandatory \nattributes. \n \nAttribute \nDescription \n_FillValue \nA value used to represent missing or undefined data \nadd_offset \nIf present, this number is to be added to the date after it is read by an application. If \nboth scale_factor and add_offset attributes are present, the date are first scaled \nbefore the offset is added. \ncalendar \nReference time calendar \ncomment \nMiscellaneous information about the data or the methods used to produce it \ncoordinates \nIdentified auxiliary coordinates variables. \nflag_meanings \nUse in conjunction with flag_values to provide descriptive words or phrase for each \nflag value. \nflag_values \nProvide a list of the flag values. Use in conjunction with flag_meanings. \n \nReference:  \nSALP-ST-M-EA-15839-CN \nVersion :  \n2.2 \nDate :  \nFebruary, 17th 2012 \nPage:  \n10/47 \nSALP Products Specification – Volume 20 : AltiKa / SARAL User Products \n \nAttribute \nDescription \ninstitution \nInstitution which provides the data \nleap_second \nUTC time at which a leap second occurs \nlong_name \nA descriptive name that indicates a variable’s content. This name is not \nstandardized. \nquality_flag \nName of the variable(s) (quality flag) representing the quality of the current  variable \nscale_factor \nIf present, the date are to be multiplied by this factor after the data are read by an \napplication. See also add_offset attribute. \nsource \nData source (model features, or observation) \nstandard_name \nA standard name that references a description of a variables content in the standard \nname table. \ntai_utc_difference \nDifference between TAI and UTC reference time \nunits \nUnit of a variable’s content. The value of this attribute must be a string that can be \nrecognized by the UNIDATA’s Udunits package. \nvalid_max \nLargest theoretical valid value of a variable (this is not the maximum of actual data). \nvalid_min \nSmallest theoretical valid value of a variable (this is not the minimum of actual data). \nTable 4 - Variable’s attributes \n2.3. \nTHE COMMON DATA LANGUAGE \nThe Common Data Language (CDL) will be used to describe the content of a data set. \nThe CDL is textual notation that described the netCDF object and it is human readable. The netCDF utility \nncdump converts netCDF objects binary to CDL text. The netCDF utility ncgen creates netCDF binary file \nfrom CDL text file. \nA CDL description of a netCDF data set takes the form: \nnetCDF name { \n \ndimension: … \n \nvariables: … \n \ndata: … \n} \nwhere the name is used only as a default in constructing file names by the ncgen utility. The CDL description \nconsists of three optional parts, introduced by the keywords dimensions variables and data. NetCDF \ndimension declarations appear after the dimensions keyword, netCDF variables and attributes are defined \nafter the variables keyword and variable data assignments appears after the data keyword. CDL statement \nare terminated by a semicolon. Spaces, tabs and newlines can be used freely for readability. Comments in \nCDL follow the characters ‘//’ on any line. \n \nReference:  \nSALP-ST-M-EA-15839-CN \nVersion :  \n2.2 \nDate :  \nFebruary, 17th 2012 \nPage:  \n11/47 \nSALP Products Specification – Volume 20 : AltiKa / SARAL User Products \n \nExample : \nnetcdf example { \n  dimensions:    \n \n \n \n \n \n//  dimensions name are declared first  \n    time = 2680; \n \nvariables: \n    double time(time);  \n \n \n \n \n// variable <type> <name>(<dimension>)  \n        time:long_name = \"time\"; \n \n \n \n// variable attributes \n        time:units = \"seconds since 2000-01-01 00:00:00.0\"; \n \n    int lon(time); \n        lon:long_name = \"longitude\"; \n        lon:standard_name = \"longitude\"; \n        lon:units = \"degrees_east\"; \n        lon:scale_factor = 1.0e-06; \n     \n \n     int alt(time); \n        alt:long_name = \"1 Hz altitude of satellite\"; \n        alt:_FillValue = 2147483647; \n        alt:units = \"m\"; \n        alt:add_offset = 1.30e+06; \n        alt:scale_factor = 1.00e-04; \n        alt:coordinates = \"lon lat\"; \n \n     byte surface_type(time);  \n \n \n \n        surface_type:long_name = \"surface type\"; \n        surface_type:_FillValue = 127b; \n        surface_type:flag_values = 0b, 1b, 2b, 3b ; \n        surface_type:flag_meanings = \"ocean lake_enclosed_sea ice land\"; \n        surface_type:coordinates = \"lon lat\"; \n        surface_type:comment = \"Computed using a DTM2000 file: 0 = open oceans or semi-enclosed \nseas; 1 = enclosed seas or lakes; 2 = continental ice; 3 = land.

The sensor transmits signals at regular interval and receives energy back \nscattered by the targets on the Earth. The DPGS generates Level 1B product from the \nsensor data. The Level 1B product carries back scattering coefficient (or sigma0) and \nother radiometric parameters along with geolocation information. The Level 4 products \nare generated from Level 1B products.  \nThis document describes format of Level 4 products of SCATSAT1 (operational version \n1.0). These are high resolution products and are generated using Scatterometer Image \nReconstruction (or SIR) technique.  \nCurrently, three parameters are given as a product: sigma0, gamma0 and brightness \ntemperature. Depending on geo location extent, various categories of a product are \ndefined. Depending on combinations of polarization/pass/look and temporal extent of \ndata, various sub-categories of Level 4 products are defined. For a product (say, of \nsigma0, gamma0 or brightness temperature), the categories are described in Table 1 \nbelow: \nTable 1 Categories of Level 4 Products \nCategory \nSub-category \nSpatial Extent \nLat.

The product \nformat is GeoTIFF. The India Products and Global Products are defined in geographic \nlat-lon grid. The Polar products are defined in Polar Projection as specified by NPs.mpp \nand SPs.mpp of NSIDC (National Snow and Ice Data Centre) maps library. The EPSG \ncodes for North and South polar projection defined by NPs.mpp and SPs.mpp are 3411 \nand 3412 respectively. The spatial resolution of INDIA products for all parameters is \n0.02°. The spatial resolution of GLOBAL sigma0 and gamma0 products is 0.02°, \nwhereas spatial resolution of GLOBAL brightness temperature product is 0.0625°.

The brief introduction of the \nformat is presented in section 2.1. Relevant information about Level 4 product is placed \nin next sub section. \n \n2.1 Details of GeoTIFF:  \nRemote sensing and its applications use data in digital form. These datasets generally \ncontain digital image along with other information which are further used for data \ninterpretation and other applications. Different communities use these data for their \nrequired purpose. To make it convenient to the users, standards are required to store these \ndatasets. Many image file formats like GIF, PGM, BMP, JPEG etc. are available \nglobally. These formats have an image header with fixed fields containing information \nsuch as image dimensions, color space specification, etc.  \nHowever, these formats have no facility to store information related to geo-location of \nimage pixels. They also do not support storage of cartographic data. Due to these \nlimitations, a new format is required to store image data along with image geometry as \nwell as cartographic information along with ancillary information required for further \nprocessing. The new format has to be platform independent, flexible and extensible. The \nTagged Image File Format (TIFF) is one of the popularly available image formats. It is \nplatform independent extensible. Several third party solutions exist for recording \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \ncartographic information using TIFF tags. The specifications for these tags (fields) are \navailable in TIFF-6.0 documents. These fields contain information ranging from the most \nprimary, like image dimensions, over the most sophisticated information like copyright, \nup to so-called 'private tags' or 'custom tags' that can define to hold application-specific \ninformation. The TIFF specification defines a framework for an image header called \n'IFD' (Image File Directory) that is essentially a flexible set of specifically those tags that \nthe TIFF writer software wishes to specify.  \nThe TIFF file format can be used to store and digital satellite image data, scanned aerial \nphotos, elevation models, scanned maps and the results of many types of geographic \nanalysis. TIFF is the only full-featured format in the public domain, capable of \nsupporting extension to include geographic metadata. GeoTIFF implements the \ngeographic metadata formally, using compliant TIFF tags and structures. A GeoTIFF file \nactually contains geographic (or cartographic) data attached as tags within the TIFF file. \nThe geographic data can then be used to position the image in the correct location and \ngeometry on the screen of a geographic information display. GeoTIFF is a metadata \nformat, which provides geographic information to associate with the image data. But the \nTIFF file structure allows both the metadata and the image data to be encoded into the \nsame file. GeoTIFF makes use of a public tag structure which is platform interoperable \nbetween any and all GeoTIFF- readers. \nThe GeoTIFF format is supported by TIFF – 6.0. That is, the GeoTIFF images conform \nin every way to the TIFF formal specifications. The tags used for the \"Geo\" portion of \nthe TIFF format conform to the acceptable and customary use of \"private\" or \"registered\" \nTIFF tags. The GeoTIFF tags and definitions are considered completely to the baseline \nand extended TIFF tag definitions currently supported in TIFF-6 by Aldus Corp.  \n \n2.2 Details of Level 4 products: \n \nA set of geographic parameters required to interpret the product for each category has \nbeen defined. This set is used for placing geographic information in GeoTIFF in form of \ntags (or keys). The sets for various categories of products are shown in Table 4 below: \n \nTable 4 (a) Parameters of INDIA and GLOBAL products \nParamter \nValue for \nINDIA \nValue for \nGLOBAL 0.02° \nValue for \nGLOBAL 0.0625° \nOutputLineSpacing \n0.02 \n0.02 \n0.0625 \nOutputPixelSpacing \n0.02 \n0.02 \n0.0625 \nNoScans \n1700 \n9000 \n2880 \nNoPixels \n1800 \n18000 \n5760 \nULLat \n39.99 \n89.99 \n89.968750 \nULLon \n64.01 \n-179.99 \n-179.968750 \nURLat \n39.99 \n89.99 \n89.968750 \n \n \n \n \n \n4 \nURLon \n99.99 \n179.99 \n179.968750 \nLRLat \n6.01 \n-89.99 \n-89.968750 \nLRLon \n99.99 \n179.99 \n179.968750 \nLLLat \n6.01 \n-89.99 \n-89.968750 \nLLLon \n64.01 \n-179.99 \n-179.968750 \nSceneCenterLat \n23.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \nSceneCenterLon \n82.00 \n180.00 \n180.00 \nEllipsoidSemiMajorAxis \n6378137.0 \n6378137.0 \n6378137.0 \nEllipsoidSemiMinorAxis 6356752.3139897 6356752.3139897 \n6356752.3139897 \n \nTable 4 (b) Parameters of POLAR products \nParameter \nValue for NORTH POLAR Value for SOUTH POLAR \nOutputLineSpacing \n2216.453682 \n2257.350185 \nOutputPixelSpacing \n2216.453682 \n2257.350185 \nNoScans \n3001 \n4001 \nNoPixels \n3001 \n4001 \nMapOriginLat \n90.0 \n-90.0 \nMapOriginLon \n-45.0 \n0.0 \nULLat \n48.457512 \n-35.429245 \nULLon \n179.999710 \n-44.989052 \nURLat \n48.457512 \n-35.429245 \nURLon \n90.002022 \n45.010746 \nLRLat \n48.457512 \n-35.429245 \nLRLon \n0.001852 \n135.010422 \nLLLat \n48.457512 \n-35.429245 \nLLLon \n-89.998314 \n-134.989563 \nULMapX \n-3323679.50 \n-4514076.50 \nULMapY \n3323713.25 \n4515802.00 \nURMapX \n3323579.00 \n4515786.00 \nURMapY \n3323813.50 \n4514092.50 \nLRMapX \n3323803.75 \n4514118.00 \nLRMapY \n-3323589.00 \n-4515760.50 \nLLMapX \n-3323598.50 \n-4515761.50 \nLLMapY \n-3323794.25 \n-4514117.00 \nSceneCenterLat \n90.0 \n-90.0 \nSceneCenterLon \n-45.0 \n0.0 \nStandardParallel1 \n70.0 \n-70.0 \nFalseEasting \n0.0 \n0.0 \nFalseNorthing \n0.0 \n0.0 \nEllipsoidSemiMajorAxis \n6378273.0 \n6378273.0 \nEllipsoidSemiMinorAxis \n6356889.4489106 \n6356889.4489106 \nEllipsoidEccentricity \n0.081816153 \n0.081816153 \n \nThe corner lat-lon and mapx-mapy values define in GeoTIFF refers to the value of centre \nof the corner pixel. \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \nThe data part of the product carries the parameter values in range defined by minimum \nand maximum defined in Table 5 below. Any value out of this range is clipped (to lower \nor upper bound of range) appropriately. The image pixels are coded as unsigned short \ninteger using slope and offset. The slope and offset are mentioned in the corresponding \nxml file. The BT value can be obtained from unsigned short integer value as shown by \nequation 1. The sigma0 or gamma0 value can be obtained from unsigned integer value as \nshown by equations 2 to 7. Basically, LSB of sigma0 or gamma0 product carries the sign \nof parameter in linear scale. Rest of the bits carry sigma0/gamma0 value in dB. \nFor BT: \nBT_value_in_degK = unsigned_short_int_value*slope + offset \n \n \n(1) \nFor sigma0 and gamma0: \nintermediate_value = unsigned_short_int_value AND (0xFFFE) \n \n \n(2) \nsign_bit = unsigned_short_int_value AND (0x0001)  \n \n \n \n(3) \npara_value_in_dB = intermediate_value*slope + offset \n \n \n \n(4) \nsign_value = -1 if sign_bit = 1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(5) \nsign_value =  1 if sign_bit = 0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(6) \npara_value_in_linear_scale = sign_value*10.0^(para_value_in_dB/10.0)  \n(7) \n \nThe absence of parameter is denoted by coded value of 65535.
